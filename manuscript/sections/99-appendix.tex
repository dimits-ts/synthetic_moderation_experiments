\subsection{Synthetic Annotation}
\label{ssec:appendix:annotation}

In order to annotate the generated discussions, we create $10$ \ac{LLM} annotator-agents, each with unique \ac{SDB} information, in the same manner as the \ac{LLM} user-agents used in the synthetic discussions. Unlike the latter, the annotator-agents are not provided with usernames (so they don't overlap with participant names), nor intents. The annotators all get the same instruction prompt (see Table \ref{tab:base_prompts}).

In many annotation tasks involving humans, a data-point is annotated only by a subset of annotators. This is usually caused by human annotation being expensive and hard to scale. Since \acp{LLM} are comparatively cheaper and more easily scalable, we choose not to sample annotator-agents.
