We also release \vmd a dataset of synthetic discussions annotated by \acp{LLM} for toxicity and argument quality. Besides being useful for data analysis, and for understanding how out-of-the-box \acp{LLM} function as moderators, we hope that the dataset can also be directly used for finetuning \acp{LLM} for moderation tasks, as generally showcased in \citet{ulmer2024}. The data can be imported as a $57,475 \times 33$ CSV file\datasetlink. The supplementary ablation dataset, as well as the code for the analysis and the graphs present in this paper, can be found in the project repository\analysislink. \textbf{\textcolor{red}{Warning: The datasets by their nature contain offensive and hateful speech.}}
