We also release \vmd\datasetlink a dataset of synthetic discussions annotated by LLMs. It can serve for finetuning facilitator LLMs, as generally showcased by \citet{ulmer2024}. The supplementary ablation dataset, as well as the code for the analysis and the graphs present in this paper, can be found in the project repository\analysislink. The dataset is licensed under a CC BY-SA license, and the software under GPLv3. \textbf{Warning: The datasets by their nature contain offensive and hateful speech.}
