We also release \vmd\datasetlink a dataset of synthetic discussions annotated by LLMs. It can serve for finetuning facilitator LLMs. We note that, as is the case with most synthetic datasets \citep{ulmer2024}, the data may need to be filtered to derive only high-quality samples---in our case filtering out discussions with constant facilitator interventions or low/extremely high diversity. However, the data can be scaled accordingly, due to the low computational cost of our methodology. The supplementary ablation dataset, as well as the code for the analysis and the graphs present in this paper, can be found in the project repository\analysislink. The dataset is licensed under a CC BY-SA license, and the software under GPLv3. \textbf{Warning: The datasets by their nature contain offensive and hateful speech.}
