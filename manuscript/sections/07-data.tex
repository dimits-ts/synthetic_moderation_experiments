We also release \vmd\datasetlink a dataset of synthetic discussions annotated by \acp{LLM}. It can serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking how \ac{LLM} facilitators would behave according to different facilitation strategies, as well as for further finetuning \acp{LLM}, as generally showcased by \citet{ulmer2024}. The supplementary ablation dataset, as well as the code for the analysis and the graphs present in this paper, can be found in the project repository\analysislink. \textbf{Warning: The datasets by their nature contain offensive and hateful speech.}
