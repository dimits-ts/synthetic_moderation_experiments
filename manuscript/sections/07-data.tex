We also release \vmd\datasetlink a dataset of synthetic discussions annotated by \acp{LLM}. It can serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking how \ac{LLM} facilitators would behave according to different facilitation strategies, as well as for further finetuning \ac{LLM} facilitators, as generally showcased by \citet{ulmer2024}. The supplementary ablation dataset, as well as the code for the analysis and the graphs present in this paper, can be found in the project repository\analysislink. The dataset is licensed under a CC BY-SA license, and the software under the \ac{GLP}v3. \textbf{Warning: The datasets by their nature contain offensive and hateful speech.}
