\paragraph{Limitations} 
Given the limited prior research and the broad scope of our experiments, we can only compare our systems to naive baselines, and evaluate it on only two metrics. As one of the first studies simulating online discussions with LLM agents, our methodology lacks strong theoretical grounding, and our approach is necessarily exploratory. Our setup is restricted by the statelessness of LLMs, which forces us to overwhelmingly resort to prompting. It also includes simplifying assumptions that may limit generalizability such as the presence of a single facilitator, and turn-taking that overlooks contextual factors like emotional engagement and relevance \cite{robert_2016_comment, Ziegele03102018}. Resource constraints further prevented us from experimenting with more elaborate prompts requiring extended context windows.
