\paragraph{Limitations} 
Given the limited prior research our methodology is mostly exploratory, and is evaluated with baselines using only two metrics. Our setup is restricted by the statelessness of LLMs, which forces us to overwhelmingly resort to prompting---however the use of open-source models prevented us from experimenting with more elaborate prompts requiring extended context windows.
