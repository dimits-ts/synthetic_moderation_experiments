\paragraph{Limitations} 
Given the limited prior research our methodology is mostly exploratory, and is evaluated with  baselines using only two metrics. Our setup is restricted by the statelessness of LLMs, which forces us to overwhelmingly resort to prompting. It also includes simplifying assumptions that may limit generalizability such as the presence of a single facilitator, and turn-taking that overlooks contextual factors like emotional engagement and relevance \cite{robert_2016_comment, Ziegele03102018}. Resource constraints further prevented us from experimenting with more elaborate prompts requiring extended context windows.
