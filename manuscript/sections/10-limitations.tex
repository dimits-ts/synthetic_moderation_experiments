\paragraph{Limitations} 
Given the limited prior research and the broad scope of our experiments, we rely on only two metrics to assess discussion quality. As one of the first studies simulating online discussions with LLM agents, our methodology lacks strong theoretical grounding. While we explore facilitation strategies, we do not claim that LLM-based agents mirror human behaviorâ€”a challenge common in social science research involving LLMs (see Section~\ref{ssec:related:human-llm}). Our setup also includes simplifying assumptions that may limit generalizability: we examine only three LLMs, restrict each discussion to a single facilitator, and use a turn-taking algorithm that overlooks contextual factors like emotional engagement and relevance \cite{robert_2016_comment, Ziegele03102018}. Resource constraints further prevented us from experimenting with more elaborate prompts requiring extended context windows.
