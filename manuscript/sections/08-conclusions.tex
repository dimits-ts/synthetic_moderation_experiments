\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We proposed a simple and generalizable methodology that enables researchers to quickly and inexpensively conduct pilot facilitation experiments using exclusively LLMs and validated it through an ablation study. We found that (1) LLM facilitators significantly improve the quality of synthetic discussions; (2) prompting these facilitators with strategies based on Social Science research does not markedly improve their performance. We also identified a consistent problem with LLMs not keeping silence when appropriate. Finally, we created an open-source Python Framework that applies this methodology to hundreds of experiments, which we used to create and publish a large-scale synthetic dataset.
