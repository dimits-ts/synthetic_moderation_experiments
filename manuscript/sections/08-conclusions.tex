\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}

We propose a methodology which enables researchers to inexpensively conduct pilot online moderation experiments using exclusively synthetic \ac{LLM} user-agents. This approach is grounded in current moderation research and incorporates techniques from numerous \acp{LLM}-human simulation studies. We demonstrate how each of these various techniques influence discussion diversity. Finally, we create an open-source Python Framework (“SynDisco”) that applies this methodology to hundreds of experiments, which we use to create and publish a large-scale synthetic dataset (the “\acf{VMD}”). Using this dataset, we observe that \textbf{TODO}.
