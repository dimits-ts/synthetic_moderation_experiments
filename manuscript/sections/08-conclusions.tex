\section{Conclusion}

We conducted a brief overview of the trade-off between complexity and efficiency for synthetic discussion methodologies, from which we derived three simple design rules. Following these rules, we proposed a simple and generalizable methodology, whose components are easily validated and which enables researchers to quickly and inexpensively conduct pilot facilitation experiments using exclusively LLMs. We found that LLM facilitators significantly improve the quality of synthetic discussions; but prompting these facilitators with strategies based on Social Science research does not markedly improve their performance. We also discovered that LLM facilitators constantly intervene, even when instructed not to. Finally, we created an open-source Python framework which applies our methodology to hundreds of experiments. We used it to create and publish a large-scale synthetic dataset, which can be used for finetuning.
