\section{Conclusion}

We proposed a simple and generalizable methodology that enables researchers to quickly and inexpensively conduct pilot facilitation experiments using exclusively LLMs and validated it through an ablation study. We found that (1) our framework contributes to a rise in data quality, (2) LLM facilitators significantly improve the quality of synthetic discussions; but prompting these facilitators with strategies based on Social Science research does not markedly improve their performance, (3) LLM facilitators constantly intervene, even when instructed not to. Finally, we created an open-source Python Framework that applies this methodology to hundreds of experiments, which we used to create and publish a large-scale synthetic dataset.
