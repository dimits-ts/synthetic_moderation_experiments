Special thanks to our colleague, Katerina Korre, for providing extensive feedback on an earlier draft.

We have used small, open source \acp{LLM} (principally LLaMa-8b and Mistral Nemo) to help in small style changes throughout this paper. We also used them in conjunction with a GPT-4 model \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport} to write initial documentation for our framework, as well as to generate some of the code for the plots and the analysis presented in this paper.
