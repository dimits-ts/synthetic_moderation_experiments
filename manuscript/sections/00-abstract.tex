    Limited large-scale evaluations exist for online moderation/facilitation strategies due to data availability and costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using \acp{LLM} to create initial pilot experiments. We propose a simple and generalizable \ac{LLM}-driven methodology, validated via an ablation study, to evaluate \ac{LLM} facilitation strategies without human participation. We assess existing facilitation strategies and introduce a novel approach based on \acf{RL}. We find that while \ac{LLM} moderators significantly improve the quality of synthetic discussions, the effect of current facilitation strategies is often statistically and qualitatively minimal compared to common baselines. Finally, we release an open-source framework, “SynDisco” (\texttt{pip install syndisco}) which facilitates large-scale discussion simulations, and release the “\ac{VMD}” dataset containing \ac{LLM}-generated and annotated discussions from multiple open-source \acp{LLM}.\datasetlink
