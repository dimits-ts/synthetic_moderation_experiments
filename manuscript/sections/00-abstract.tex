\begin{abstract}
    Limited large-scale evaluations exist for online facilitation strategies due to significant costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using \acp{LLM} to create initial pilot experiments. We propose a simple and generalizable \ac{LLM}-driven methodology to prototype \ac{LLM} moderators, and produce high-quality synthetic data without human involvement. We use our methodology to test whether modern facilitation strategies can improve  the performance of \ac{LLM} facilitators. We find that, while \ac{LLM} facilitators significantly improve synthetic discussions, there is no evidence suggesting that the application of modern facilitation strategies leads to further improvements in discussion quality. Finally, we validate that each component of our methodology contributes meaningfully to high quality data via an ablation study,  we release an open-source framework, \syndisco\pip  which implements our methodology, and release \vmd a large, publicly available dataset containing \ac{LLM}-generated and annotated discussions from multiple open-source \acp{LLM}.\datasetlink
