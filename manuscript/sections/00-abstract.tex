    Limited large-scale evaluations exist for online moderation strategies due to data availability and costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using \acp{LLM} to create initial pilot experiments. We propose a simple and generalizable \ac{LLM}-driven methodology, validated via an ablation study, to evaluate \ac{LLM} moderation approaches without human participation. We assess existing methods and introduce a novel approach that outperforms baselines and enhances synthetic discussions. We release an open-source framework, “SynDisco” (\texttt{pip install syndisco}) which facilitates large-scale simulations, and release the “\ac{VMD}” dataset containing \ac{LLM}-generated and annotated discussions from multiple open-source \acp{LLM}.\datasetlink
