\begin{abstract}
    Limited large-scale evaluations exist for online facilitation strategies due to significant costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using \acp{LLM} to create initial pilot experiments. We propose a simple and generalizable \ac{LLM}-driven methodology, validated via an ablation study, to evaluate \ac{LLM} facilitation strategies without human participation. We aggregate and assess existing facilitation strategies and introduce a novel approach based on \acf{RL}. We find that while \ac{LLM} moderators significantly improve the quality of synthetic discussions, the effect of current facilitation strategies is often qualitatively minimal compared to common baselines. Finally, we release an open-source framework, \syndisco\pip  which facilitates large-scale discussion simulations, and release \vmd a large, publicly available dataset containing \ac{LLM}-generated and annotated discussions from multiple open-source \acp{LLM}.\datasetlink
