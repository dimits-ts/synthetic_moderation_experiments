\section{Discussion}
\paragraph{Future Work}Future work should identify additional robust quality metrics to evaluate the utility of synthetic data, and discussion quality. The latter can then be used to examine the applicability of our findings obtained regarding optimal facilitation strategies, to discussions involving humans. It would also be interesting to explore how to prompt LLMs with complex facilitation strategies.
