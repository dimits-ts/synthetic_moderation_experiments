\section{Discussion}
\paragraph{Future Work} Future work should identify additional quality metrics to evaluate the utility of synthetic data, and discussion quality. The latter can then be used to examine the applicability of our findings obtained regarding optimal facilitation strategies, to discussions involving humans. It would also be interesting to explore how to more effectively prompt LLMs with complex facilitation strategies, or alternative formulations of our methodology, as described in this paper.
