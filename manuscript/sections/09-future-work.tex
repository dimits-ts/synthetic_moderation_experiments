Future work should identify additional robust quality metrics to evaluate the realism and utility of synthetic data, and examine the applicability of findings obtained on synthetic data (e.g., regarding optimal moderation strategies) to discussions involving humans. Moreover, it would be interesting to explore whether base  (non-instruction-tuned) models can generate synthetic discussions that are more aligned with observed human behaviors than their instruction-tuned variants \cite{anthis_2025}. Finally, synthetic discussion simulations may have the potential to train human moderators before exposing them to real-world discussions that necessitate intervention.
