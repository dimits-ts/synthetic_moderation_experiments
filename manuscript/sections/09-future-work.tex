Future work should study the correlation between findings on synthetic data (e.g., regarding the best moderation strategies) and findings on real-world data. While it is unlikely that synthetic experiments will produce identical results with real-life discussions, it is important to learn which aspects of a discussion can be replicated by \acp{LLM}, and to what degree. Finally, it would be worth exploring to what extent synthetic discussion environments could be used to better train human moderators, before exposing them to real-world discussions that need moderation.
