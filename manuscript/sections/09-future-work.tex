Future work should identify additional robust quality metrics to evaluate the utility of synthetic data, and examine the applicability of findings obtained on  them (e.g., regarding optimal facilitation strategies) to discussions involving humans. It would also be interesting to explore whether non-instruction-tuned models can generate synthetic discussions that are more aligned with observed human behaviors \cite{anthis_2025}. Finally, synthetic discussion simulations may have the potential to train human facilitators before exposing them to real-world online discussions.
