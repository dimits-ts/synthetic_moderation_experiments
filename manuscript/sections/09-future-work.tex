Future work should identify robust quality metrics to evaluate the realism and utility of synthetic data, and examine the applicability of findings obtained on synthetic data (e.g., regarding optimal moderation strategies). Moreover, there is a need to explore whether base  (non-instruction-tuned) models can generate synthetic discussions that are more aligned with observed human behaviors than their instruction-tuned variants \cite{anthis_2025}. Finally, synthetic discussion simulations have the potential to generate high quality data for finetuning moderator models, and perhaps even to train human moderators before exposing them to real-world discussions that necessitate intervention.
