\paragraph{Ethical considerations} 
Synthetic discussions involving LLMs could be exploited by malicious actors to train them at performing unethical tasks \cite{majumdar_2024_nefarious, MARULLI20245340, li_2025_vulnerable}, although ongoing research is addressing these vulnerabilities \cite{wang_2025_risk}. Furthermore, the use of LLMs inherently risks skewing moderation systems towards the predominant demographics best represented in their training data. SDB prompts are a necessary but insufficient step towards avoiding this \cite{rossi_2024, anthis_2025, burton2024large}.

\paragraph{AI use statement} LLMs were used solely for styling and text corrections in this document. They were also partially used for generating framework documentation, and code for some of the presented graphs. All such changes and additions have been checked by the authors.
