\paragraph{Ethical Considerations} 
Synthetic discussions involving LLMs could be exploited by malicious actors to make LLM user-agents more capable at performing unethical tasks \cite{majumdar_2024_nefarious, MARULLI20245340}. Notably, LLMs currently lack robust defenses against these types of attacks \cite{li_2025_vulnerable}, although ongoing research is addressing these vulnerabilities \cite{wang_2025_risk}. Furthermore, the use of LLMs inherently risks skewing moderation systems towards the predominant demographics best represented in their training data. SDB prompts are a necessary step towards avoiding this, but remain insufficient for verifiable, equitable representation \cite{rossi_2024, anthis_2025, burton2024large}.
