\section{Ethical Considerations}
\label{sec:ethical}

Synthetic discussions involving \acp{LLM} could be exploited by malicious actors to make \ac{LLM} user-agents more capable at performing unethical tasks \cite{majumdar_2024_nefarious, MARULLI20245340}. Such actors could adapt our methodology to  maximize toxicity, disrupt human discussions, or learn to circumvent moderation mechanisms to propagate misinformation or spread specific agendas. Notably, \acp{LLM} currently lack robust defenses against these types of attacks \cite{li_2025_vulnerable}, although ongoing research is addressing these vulnerabilities \cite{wang_2025_risk}.

Even in non-malicious contexts, researchers deploying \ac{LLM} facilitators in real-world communities must do so with transparency and explicit community consent. The undisclosed use of \ac{LLM} agents can erode trust, be perceived as manipulative \cite{retraction_watch}, and potentially violate regulatory standards such as the EU AI Act \cite{eu_ai_act_2024}. Furthermore, the inherent biases within \acp{LLM} risk skewing moderation systems towards the predominant demographics best represented in their training data, often at the expense of disadvantaged or underrepresented groups \cite{rossi_2024, anthis_2025, burton2024large}. While the use of \ac{SDB} prompts is a necessary step toward inclusivity, it remains insufficient for verifiable, equitable representation \cite{rossi_2024}.

Additionally, our methodology is designed around batch production of synthetic discussions, each of which necessitates multiple \ac{LLM} inference calls. The potential of our methodology to significantly scale experiments may have non-trivial, adverse environmental effects \cite{ding_2024_sustainable, Ren2024}. 

Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge that while \acp{LLM} can approximate aspects of human behavior, they do not reliably replicate it (\S\ref{ssec:related:human-llm}). Consequently, this research should be viewed as a foundation for pilot experiments, and conclusions about human behavior should be drawn with caution when based solely on synthetic data.
