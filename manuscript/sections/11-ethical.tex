\section{Ethical Considerations}

The software and methodology presented raises significant ethical concerns, as synthetic discussions involving \acp{LLM} could be exploited by malicious actors to make \ac{LLM} user-agents more capable at performing unethical tasks. Such actors might aim to maximize toxicity, disrupt human discussions, or circumvent moderation mechanisms to propagate misinformation or spread specific agendas. Additionally, while \acp{LLM} can approximate human behavior, they cannot reliably replicate it. Therefore, this research should primarily serve to create pilot experiments, followed by rigorous human-subject studies to ensure the reliability and validity of findings.
