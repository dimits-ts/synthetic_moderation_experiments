\section{Virtual Moderation Dataset}

We release a dataset of synthetic discussions and annotations. The dataset consists of $24$ discussions ($8$ per model—see Table \ref{tab:models}) for each of the $6$ moderator configurations (see Section \ref{ssec:setup:strategies}). Each discussion features $28$ comments ($14$ participant comments and $14$ possible interventions), apart from the “No moderator” baseline, which only includes participant comments. Each of these comments is annotated by 10 different \ac{LLM} annotators for toxicity and argument quality. The data can be imported as a $61,147 \times 33$ CSV file \datasetlink, or as a collection of JSON files, found in the data and analysis repository \analysislink.
