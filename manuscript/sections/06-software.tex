\section{Datasets \& Software}

We introduce SynDisco, an open-source, lightweight, purpose-built framework for managing, annotating, and generating synthetic discussions. Key features include: 
\begin{itemize}[nosep, noitemsep]
    \item  Three core functions: discussion management, synthetic annotation, and mass generation of randomized discussion and annotation tasks.
    \item  Built-in fault tolerance (automated recovery and intermittent saving) and file logging to support extended experiments.
    \item Easy installation via PIP (\texttt{pip install syndisco}).
\end{itemize}
