We introduce \syndisco\syndiscolink an open-source, lightweight, purpose-built framework for managing, annotating, and generating synthetic discussions. The key features of the framework include: 
\begin{itemize}[nosep, noitemsep]
    \item Three core functions: generating discussion setups (selecting participants, topics, roles, etc.), executing, and annotating them according to user-provided parameters.
    \item  Built-in fault tolerance (automated recovery and intermittent saving) and file logging to support extended experiments.
    \item Available via PIP \pip.
\end{itemize}
