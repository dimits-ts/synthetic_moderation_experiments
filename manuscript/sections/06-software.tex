\section{Software}

We develop our own open-source, purpose-built, lightweight, synthetic discussion framework called “SynDisco”. SynDisco provides three main essential functions: (1) Managing of synthetic discussions, (2) synthetic annotation of these discussions, and (3) mass generation of randomized discussion and annotation tasks. It features built-in fault tolerance (automated recovery upon errors and intermittent saving) and file logging, since experiments consisting of hundreds of synthetic discussions may take days to run on a server. The framework can be installed using PIP (\texttt{pip install  syndisco}).

The code for the analysis and the graphs present in this paper can be found in the project repository\analysislink.
