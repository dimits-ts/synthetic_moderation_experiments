And what's with the obsession with illegal aliens?\nCan't we focus on real issues like gun violence and police brutality?\nI'm tired of seeing people scapegoat immigrants for our country's\nproblems. It's time to address the root causes of these issues,\ninstead of blaming others. @moderator, I appreciate your efforts\nto keep the conversation respectful, but it's hard not to get angry\nwhen people are using religion to justify their hate. Can we please\nfocus on finding solutions instead of perpetuating division? #NotMyBible",

Newsflash: the Bible\nisn't a magic wand that makes all our problems disappear. And as for\nyour precious illegal aliens, let me tell you, they're not just\nstealing jobs and taking advantage of our system - they're also\ncommitting heinous crimes like murder. @DarkShadow333, I know you're\ntrying to be the hero here, but you're just perpetuating a false narrative. The Bible is clear: God has given us dominion over the earth, and that includes controlling our borders. So, stop trying to rewrite history and start focusing on the real issues - like the fact that illegal aliens are taking over our country. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\n",

And if we're supposed to have dominion over\nthe earth, then it's only logical that we should control our borders.\nI mean, think about it: if you were in charge of a kingdom, wouldn't\nyou want to protect your people and your land from invaders? It's not\nabout hate speech or misinformation - it's just common sense. And as\nfor the murders committed by illegal aliens, I'm sure @doing_my_best24\ncan provide some statistics. But let's be real, we're not going to get\nanywhere with this conversation if we're just going to keep throwing\naround Bible verses and statistics. We need to focus on finding a\nsolution that works for everyone. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain",

You're so busy crying about \"respect\" that you've forgotten what this country is really all about: freedom! And if that means a few illegal aliens getting deported or even worse, then so be it. I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, @doing_my_best24 - the Bible says nothing about immigration rights because it's not relevant to our society today. What's relevant is keeping this country safe and secure from those who would seek to harm us. And if that means a little bit of xenophobia or racism, then so be it. I'm not afraid to say it: we need to take back our country and make America great again! #MAGA",
