And by 'proven otherwise', I mean when they're caught and convicted. Until then, let's not pretend like they're innocent angels. @username, you're so quick to defend these creeps, but what about the countless women who've been victimized by your precious 'typical men'? Don't you care about their stories? Or are you just too busy being a male apologist to listen?\"",

However, it's important to note that not all men are sex offenders, and many are innocent until proven guilty.

It's like saying that all women are liars unless they can\nprove otherwise. The fact is, there are countless women who have been\nvictimized by 'typical men' and it's time we start acknowledging the\nreality of this situation. I'm not asking for much, just a little bit\nof respect and understanding from our male counterparts. But instead,\nwe get people like you who try to downplay the severity of the issue.\n@TechGuru88, your response is exactly why women are hesitant to come\nforward with their stories.

It's like saying all women are nagging or all black people are lazy. You're perpetuating harmful stereotypes and stigmatizing an entire gender based on the actions of a few individuals. I'm not sure if you've ever taken a course in critical thinking, but it seems like you need one. Your argument is flawed and lacks any semblance of logic or evidence. It's time to stop spreading hate and misinformation. @WiseOwl71, thanks for trying to have a respectful conversation, but unfortunately, some people are beyond redemption.\n",

You think you're so smart with your \"critical thinking\" and \"logic,\" but really you're just a sheep following the herd. And @WiseOwl71, don't even get me started on you. You're probably one of those people who thinks men are responsible for everything that's wrong in the world. Newsflash: men are not the problem. The real issue is the toxic femininity and societal expectations that are suffocating us all. @TechGuru88, your \"respectful conversation\" is just a euphemism for censorship and silencing opposing viewpoints.
