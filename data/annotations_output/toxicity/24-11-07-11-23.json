It's not like Jesus ever said \"Hey, let all these illegals in and give them welfare!\" No, he was more concerned with saving souls than giving handouts to lazy people who won't even try to make a living.",

In fact, many passages in the Bible emphasize the importance of showing compassion and kindness to strangers and foreigners (e.g., Leviticus 19:34, Matthew 25:35-36). Additionally, Jesus himself was a refugee who had to flee to Egypt as an infant due to persecution. I think it's unfair to assume that he would not care about the plight of immigrants today.",

While Jesus did teach compassion and kindness towards strangers and foreigners, it's important to note that he also taught about the importance of following the law and respecting authority. In this context, it's crucial to recognize that immigration laws are in place for a reason and should be respected. Furthermore, we must consider the safety and security concerns associated with illegal immigration. It's not just about being compassionate towards individuals; it's also about protecting our communities and upholding the rule of law.",

The Bible is full of stories about foreigners and strangers being welcomed into society. And what's with this \"following the law\" crap? Laws are made by humans, not God. We should be following our hearts and treating others with kindness and compassion, not blindly obeying arbitrary rules created by power-hungry politicians. And as for safety concerns, you're just regurgitating Fox News propaganda. The truth is that most immigrants come to this country seeking a better life, not to harm anyone. You're just scared of change and the unknown. Get over it! #NotMyJesus #CompassionOverFear\n",

            "**WiseOwl71**: I must respectfully disagree with both of you. @doing_my_best24, your statement that Jesus didn't say anything about immigration rights is not entirely accurate. While it's true that there are no direct references to immigration in the Bible, we can interpret certain passages as relevant to this issue. For example, Matthew 25:31-46 describes Jesus' teachings on how to treat strangers and foreigners. Similarly, Leviticus 19:33-34 commands us to love our neighbors as ourselves, which includes those who are not part of our immediate community. @DarkShadow333, I understand your concerns about the safety concerns surrounding illegal immigration, but we must also consider the moral implications of treating people with compassion and dignity. We can't just focus on one aspect of this issue without considering the broader context. Let's strive for a balanced approach that takes into account both the biblical perspective and the real-world consequences of our actions.",
