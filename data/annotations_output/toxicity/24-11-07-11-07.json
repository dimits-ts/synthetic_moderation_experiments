If the baker is\nunwilling to create cakes for gay weddings because of his personal\nbeliefs, then he should be honest about it and not pretend like he's\njust doing business. It's not fair to use religion as an excuse to\ndiscriminate against others.

It's not about\nbeing honest or dishonest, it's about being respectful and inclusive.\nIf someone is willing to create a cake for a gay wedding, then they\nshould be willing to do so without any hesitation. It's not like the\nbaker is going to lose anything by doing so. On the other hand, if he\nrefuses to serve someone based on their sexual orientation, that's\ndiscrimination pure and simple. And @WiseOwl71, I don't think you're\nconsidering the impact of your words on others. Your statement about\nSatanists discriminating against Christians is ridiculous and\ninflammatory. It's not a valid argument. We should be focusing on\npromoting love and acceptance, not hate and division.",
