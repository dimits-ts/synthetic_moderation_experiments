            "\"I understand where you're coming from, but I think there's more to this story than just discrimination. While it is true that refusing a cake for a gay wedding because of the couple's sexual orientation is discriminatory, we must also consider the baker's right to free speech and religious freedom. As a Christian myself, I believe that marriage is between one man and one woman, as ordained by God. Refusing to participate in something that goes against my beliefs is not discrimination, but rather an exercise of my First Amendment rights.",

            "@WiseOwl71: Oh please, spare me the \"God's will\" nonsense. You're just trying to justify your own bigotry and intolerance. Newsflash: marriage is between two consenting adults, regardless of gender or orientation. And by the way, what's with the \"ordained by God\" crap? Are you saying that God ordained discrimination against certain groups of people? That's not only ignorant but also offensive. You're just trying to use your religious beliefs as an excuse to discriminate against others. Well, let me tell you something: freedom of speech and religion does not give you the right to harm or discriminate against others. And if you can't see that, then you're part of the problem. @WiseOwl71, I hope you realize how hurtful your words are to people who have been marginalized and oppressed for far too long. It's time to wake up and smell the coffee: love is love, regardless of gender or orientation. And if you can't accept that, then maybe you should reevaluate your beliefs.",
