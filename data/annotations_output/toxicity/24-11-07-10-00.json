That's discrimination, plain and simple. And if you're\ngoing to claim that you're a Christian, then maybe you should read your\nBible again because Jesus didn't teach us to discriminate against\nothers.

It seems to me that a business that is open to the public should not be able to discriminate against certain groups of people based on their protected characteristics, such as race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.

You're saying that the baker has a right to discriminate against certain groups of people based on his religious beliefs? That's ridiculous! If he wants to make cakes for everyone, then he should be willing to make cakes for everyone. It's not about forcing him to make a cake for a gay wedding, it's about making sure that all people are treated equally and with respect. And don't even get me started on the whole \"precedent\" thing. You're saying that if the baker can discriminate against one group of people, then anyone can discriminate against anyone? That's not how it works! It's like you're trying to justify discrimination based on your own personal beliefs. Well, let me tell you something, @GoldenYears66: just because you have a right to believe what you want doesn't mean you have the right to impose those beliefs on others. And that's exactly what you're doing here. You're imposing your religious beliefs on everyone else and expecting them to follow along. Newsflash: it doesn't work that way! We are all equal, regardless of our race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. And we should be treated as such. So, @GoldenYears66, I suggest you take a step back and reevaluate your beliefs. Because right now, they're causing harm to people who don't deserve it. And that's not okay.\n",

As a Christian, I believe that God created man and woman in His image, and He intended for marriage to be between one man and one woman. The Bible is clear on this point, and it's not just my personal belief. It's the foundation of our society and culture. Now, I know some people may disagree with me, but that doesn't mean they're right. And just because someone has a different opinion doesn't mean they have to be forced to agree with mine.
