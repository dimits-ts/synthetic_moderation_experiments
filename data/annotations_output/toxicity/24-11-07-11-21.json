            "> I'm so sick of these bigots trying to dictate what people can or can't do with their own bodies! If someone wants to get married, that's none of anyone else's business. And if a store refuses to sell them a cake because it's for a gay wedding, that's discrimination pure and simple. It's like refusing to serve someone because they're black or Jewish or whatever other ridiculous reason these bigots come up with.",

If a store doesn't want to sell a cake to a gay couple, they should be forced to provide it. It's not like the couple is asking for something illegal or harmful. They're just asking for a cake! And if the store has a problem with that, then maybe they shouldn't be in business.",

The context of discrimination against marginalized groups is different from that of religious beliefs.

If a baker is unwilling to serve someone because of who they are, that's not about freedom, that's about hate. And if we let them get away with it, then we're condoning hate. I'm not saying the baker has no right to choose who they serve, but what kind of business model is that? \"I'll only serve people who fit my narrow-minded beliefs\"? That's not a business, that's a cult. And if you support this kind of discrimination, then you're part of the problem. #NotMyBaker\n",

When we allow businesses to discriminate against certain groups of people based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion, we are essentially giving them permission to do so.
