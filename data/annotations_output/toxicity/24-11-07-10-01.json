It's not about \"art\" or \"business transactions\", it's about basic human decency and respect. If you can't see the harm in discriminating against someone based on their sexual orientation, then I don't know what to say. You're just perpetuating hate and ignorance.",

It's about time someone stood up to these bigots who think they can hide behind their \"art\" and \"business transactions.\" And @GoldenYears66, your point about precedent is spot on. If we allow discrimination based on sexual orientation, what's to stop us from allowing it based on race or religion? It's a slippery slope, my friends.

The baker has the right to choose who he wants to serve based on his religious beliefs. However, we must also consider the rights of others, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.
