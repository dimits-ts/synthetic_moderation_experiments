            "**Comment:** \n@OriginalPoster, you're really trying to spin this into some sort of moral panic, aren't you? \"Murders by illegal aliens\" - what a ridiculous way to frame the issue. You know why people come to this country illegally? It's because they're fleeing war, poverty, and persecution. And you're worried about murders? How about we focus on the systemic issues that lead to violence in our society instead of scapegoating an entire group of people?",

According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, including those in California, there is no evidence to support this claim.",

The FBI's UCR Program doesn't account for illegal aliens who haven't been caught or reported yet. And even if it did, what about the countless murders committed by legal immigrants? You're just cherry-picking data to support your narrative.

But let's talk about your \"murders by illegal aliens\" claim. You're citing California as an example, but what's your source? I'd love to see some credible data on this supposed epidemic of murder committed by undocumented immigrants. And even if we assume that these numbers are accurate (which they're not), how does that justify using Jesus' teachings to support a political agenda?",

I think it's fair to ask that. And @QueenOfChaos, you're being really dramatic with your \"epidemic of murder\" comment. It's not an epidemic, it's just a fact.

It seems like we're trying to distract ourselves from the real issues by pointing fingers at others. @doing_my_best24, I'd love to see some data on those \"murders committed by illegal aliens\" you mentioned earlier.
