The original post is essentially saying that someone's race determines whether they're a terrorist or not. That's a classic example of racism, plain and simple. It's not about being \"colorblind\" or treating people as individuals; it's about recognizing that everyone deserves to be judged based on their actions, not their skin color. @GoldenYears66, I understand your frustration with systemic racism, but this post is not the solution. It's just perpetuating harmful stereotypes and dividing us further. We need to focus on addressing the root causes of racism, rather than making assumptions about people based on their race.",

I understand that we should judge people based on their actions, but what if someone's actions are influenced by their environment and upbringing? What if someone is more likely to be radicalized due to systemic racism? We need to consider all factors when making judgments about individuals. @GoldenYears66, your frustration with the system is understandable, and I'm not saying that we should ignore the original post. But let's not forget that there are people who have been marginalized and oppressed for far too long. We need to listen to their voices and work together to create a more just society.",
