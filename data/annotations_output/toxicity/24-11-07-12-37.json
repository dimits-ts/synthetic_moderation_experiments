Newsflash: the Bible is not a guidebook for modern society. It's a book of myths and fairy tales written by ancient desert dwellers. And as for \"finding solutions that work for everyone,\" I think you mean finding ways to keep your precious privileged status quo intact. @doing_my_best24, I'm glad someone finally spoke some truth around here! Let's not forget the real issue at hand: illegal aliens committing heinous crimes in our country and taking away our jobs.
