            "@WiseOwl71: You think you're so smart with your \"Bible teachings\" but let me tell you something, pal. The Bible is just a book written by old men who didn't know any better. It's not relevant to our modern society and it shouldn't be used as a basis for making laws or policies. And another thing, what does the Bible have to do with immigration rights? You're just trying to deflect from the real issue at hand: the fact that illegal aliens are committing crimes left and right in this country. @WiseOwl71, you're just a bleeding heart liberal who doesn't care about the safety of American citizens.",
