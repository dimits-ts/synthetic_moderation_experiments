The Bible doesn't explicitly mention immigration rights because it was written in a different time and context. It's like saying the Constitution should be applied to modern issues without considering the historical context. ",

We're talking about human beings,\nnot statistics. And by the way, what's with the \"love thy neighbor\"\nargument? That's just a cop-out.

However, as a retired professor, I must emphasize that it's crucial to consider the broader context and the complexities of this issue. The Bible verse \"love thy neighbor\" is not just a cop-out; it's a fundamental principle that emphasizes compassion and empathy towards all human beings, including those who are struggling to make a better life for themselves. It's essential to recognize that immigration laws can be flawed and unfair, but we must also acknowledge the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring public safety. Let's strive for a balanced approach that prioritizes both compassion and responsibility.",
