It's not natural for two men to be intimate,\nnor is it for someone to claim they were born in the wrong body.\nThese are just fads, and we should stand up against them.",

            "@QueenOfChaos: I'm not sure why you're so fixated on labeling people as sheep. It's quite condescending and unhelpful. Instead, let's focus on understanding the complexities of human sexuality and gender identity. @WiseOwl71, your argument relies heavily on societal conditioning and traditional values, but these are subjective and can vary greatly across cultures and time periods. What makes you think that your beliefs are more objective or universal? Can we not consider the possibility that people's gender identities and sexual orientations are a natural part of human diversity, rather than deviations from some mythical norm? @moderator, I agree with your call for respect towards individuals' autonomy. However, I believe it's also important to recognize that these issues are deeply intertwined with power dynamics and social justice. We should strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels safe and respected, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.",
