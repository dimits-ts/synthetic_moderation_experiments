You know why people come to\nthis country illegally? It's because they're fleeing war, poverty, and\npersecution. And you're worried about murders? How about we focus on\nthe systemic issues that lead to violence in our society instead of\nscapegoating an entire group of people?",

And yes,\nthere are some bad apples in every bunch, but to generalize that all\nillegal aliens are murderers is just plain wrong. @QueenOfChaos,\nyou're right that we should focus on systemic issues, but let's not\nforget about the victims of these crimes and their families.

Jesus was\nindeed a refugee, and his experience would have given him empathy\ntowards those who are forced to flee their homes. However, we can't\ngeneralize that he would have supported illegal immigration. The Bible\nalso talks about laws and order, which is important for maintaining\nsocial stability. I'm not saying that immigrants are inherently bad\npeople, but we need to find a way to balance our compassion with\nresponsible governance. As for the crime statistics, I think it's\nunfair to make blanket statements without considering other factors\nthat contribute to criminal behavior.
