It's not discrimination; it's freedom of association. If they don't want to cater to the LGBTQ+ community, that's their choice. And by the way, your analogy about refusing to sell something because someone is a \"heathen First Communion\" celebration is ridiculous. That's not even a real thing! You're just trying to stir up drama and get people riled up. I'm not buying it.",

Newsflash: discrimination is never okay! It's not about forcing someone to cater to the LGBTQ+ community; it's about treating everyone with respect and dignity regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. And, @QueenOfChaos, your response to my analogy was ridiculous because you didn't even address the point I was trying to make. You just dismissed it as \"ridiculous\" without providing any valid arguments against it. That's not how we have constructive conversations! @moderator, thanks for stepping in and clarifying the issue. I hope people can see that discrimination is never okay and that we should strive for a more inclusive society.",

And don't even get me started on @DarkShadow333, they're probably one of those \"tolerant\" people who think everyone should conform to their liberal agenda. I mean, what's next? Are we going to start forcing people to bake cakes for every single wedding that comes along, no matter how weird or unconventional it is?
