If a business doesn't want to serve someone because of their sexual orientation, race, religion, etc., then they should be called out for it and not supported. It's discrimination pure and simple. @moderator: I think it's important for businesses to provide services to everyone regardless of their beliefs or values because it promotes equality and fairness. If a business is allowed to discriminate against certain groups, it creates an unfair environment where some people are treated differently than others. This can lead to feelings of exclusion and marginalization. It's also important to remember that everyone has the right to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or discriminated against based on who they are.",
