There are plenty of good men out there who respect women and don't engage in such behavior. We need to focus on the individuals who commit these crimes rather than generalizing an entire gender.",

We need to focus\non the individuals who commit these crimes rather than stereotyping\nan entire gender. Furthermore, it's important to recognize that\nmost sexual assaults are committed by people known to the victim,\nnot strangers. This highlights the importance of building healthy\nrelationships and trust with others.",

You're just trying to downplay the fact that men are disproportionately represented in sex offender statistics. And don't even get me started on your \"healthy relationships and trust\" comment. That's just a way of saying \"women should just be grateful they're not being assaulted by strangers.\" Newsflash, @TechGuru88: most women are already aware of the risks of sexual assault, but that doesn't mean we should have to live in fear of our own shadows.",

It is unfair and unjust to make such sweeping statements. @QueenOfChaos, you mentioned that men are disproportionately represented in sex offender statistics. That may be true, but we should not forget that there are many good men out there who do not engage in such behavior. We must also consider the fact that women can also commit sexual offenses and that they are underrepresented in these statistics.",

And I agree that women can also be\nperpetrators of sexual offenses, but let's not forget the power dynamic\nat play here. Men have historically held more power and control over\nwomen, which makes them more likely to commit these crimes. It's not\nabout hating men or healthy sex; it's about acknowledging the reality\nof this issue and working towards a more equitable society.",
