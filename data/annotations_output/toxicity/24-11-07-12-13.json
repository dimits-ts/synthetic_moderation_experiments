And as for transgender individuals, they are who they say they are - it's not about 'deviation' from anything, it's about living their truth.

Homosexuality and transgenderism are natural aspects of human diversity and should be respected as such. It's important to recognize that people are born with different sexual orientations and gender identities, and it's not a choice they make. We should strive for inclusivity and acceptance in our society, rather than promoting discrimination and marginalization.",

Homosexuality and transgenderism are\nclearly deviations from normal human behavior. It's not natural for a\nman to want to have sex with another man, or for someone to think they\nare the opposite gender. These things are just plain wrong. We need\nto stop accepting this nonsense and promote traditional values.",

            "**Response:** @doing_my_best24 Oh please, spare me the \"it's not natural\" argument. Homosexuality has been present in every culture throughout history, so it's hardly unnatural. And as for transgenderism, people have always identified with different genders and expressions of gender. You can't just dismiss someone's identity because it doesn't fit your narrow view of what is \"normal\". It's not about promoting traditional values, it's about respecting people's autonomy and allowing them to live their lives without fear of persecution or discrimination. And by the way, if you're so concerned about \"traditional values\", why don't you focus on the real issues like poverty, inequality, and climate change instead of trying to dictate how other people should live their lives? @doing_my_best24, your comment is just a thinly veiled attempt to justify discrimination against marginalized groups. It's not okay to use your platform to spread hate speech and misinformation. I hope you can learn to be more empathetic and understanding towards others.\n",

Homosexuality is\na sin, plain and simple. And as for transgenderism, it's just not\nnatural. People are born male or female, and they should accept their\nbiological gender.
