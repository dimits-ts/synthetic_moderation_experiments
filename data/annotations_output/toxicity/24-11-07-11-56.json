            "@QueenOfChaos I'm glad you brought up the point about being \"brown\nenough\" because it highlights the absurdity of these racial\nprofiling accusations. It's like we're living in some kind of twisted\nreality where people are judged based on their skin color rather than\ntheir actions. And don't even get me started on how ridiculous it is\nto label someone a terrorist just because they have a different\ncomplexion. I mean, come on, what about the countless white\nterrorists who have committed heinous crimes? Are we going to start\nlabeling them as \"white terrorists\" too? It's time we stop playing\nthis game of racial profiling and focus on the real issues at hand.",
