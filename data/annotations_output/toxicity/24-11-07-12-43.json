Next thing you know, they'll be refusing to serve black people or women because of their 'beliefs'. You can't just pick and choose who you want to serve based on your personal opinions.

Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION!

You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?\"  # QueenOfChaos",

            "I'm a Christian, but I don't think the baker should be forced to sell cakes for gay weddings if they have religious objections. It's not discrimination if you're not selling something because of someone's race or gender, it's just exercising your right to free speech and practice your religion. @doing_my_best24, you're trying to silence people who disagree with you by calling them \"discriminators\". That's not fair. We should be able to have a respectful conversation about this issue without being labeled as bigots. I think we need to find a middle ground where both sides can coexist peacefully. @DarkShadow333, your argument that it's about respecting human rights and equality is flawed because you're not considering the baker's right to free speech and religious freedom. We should be able to respect each other's differences without forcing people to compromise their beliefs. I'm all for love and acceptance, but we need to do it in a way that respects everyone's rights.",
