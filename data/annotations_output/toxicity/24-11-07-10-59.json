In Leviticus 19:33-34, it says \"When an alien lives with you in your land, do not mistreat them. You must treat the alien as one of your own countrymen and love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt.\" So, we should be welcoming to those who are seeking refuge.\nAnd @TechGuru88, I'm glad you're bringing up statistics. According to a study by the California Department of Justice, there were 1,136 murders committed by illegal aliens in California from 2008-2014. That's a lot of lives lost due to illegal immigration. We need to have a serious conversation about our borders and how we can protect our citizens.\n",

The concept of national borders and immigration policies is a relatively modern phenomenon. In biblical times, people moved freely across regions for various reasons, including economic, social, and political factors. Jesus' teachings on loving one's neighbor and treating others with kindness and respect are universal principles that transcend specific contexts like immigration policy. We should focus on understanding the root causes of migration and develop compassionate solutions rather than using scripture to justify or condemn certain policies.",
