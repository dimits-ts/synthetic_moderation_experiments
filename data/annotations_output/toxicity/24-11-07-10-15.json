It's important to recognize that not all men are sex offenders, but it's also crucial to acknowledge the systemic issues that contribute to this behavior. We need to work towards creating a society where women feel safe and respected, and where men are held accountable for their actions. @GoldenYears66, I appreciate your nuanced perspective, and @moderator, you're right that we can't ignore the root causes of these crimes.

Your point about systemic issues is well-taken. It's essential that we address the root causes of these crimes and work towards creating a society where everyone feels safe and respected. I agree with you that men should be held accountable for their actions, but it's also important to recognize that not all men are sex offenders. We need to focus on promoting healthy masculinity and encouraging men to respect women's boundaries. Let's continue this conversation and explore ways we can work together to create a better world for everyone. @GoldenYears66\n",

You can keep pretending that\nnot all men are sex offenders, but I know the truth.
