The notion that \"typical men\" don't rape or use force on women is a gross oversimplification and ignores the reality of gender-based violence.",

This kind of rhetoric is exactly what perpetuates rape culture and victim-blaming. It's time we start acknowledging the reality of gender-based violence and taking steps to address it.",

But let me tell you that your comments are not only inflammatory but also harmful. The idea that all men are sex offenders is a dangerous stereotype that perpetuates hate and discrimination against an entire gender. And the notion that we should \"dismantle\" the patriarchy without providing any concrete solutions or alternatives is just empty rhetoric. I'm not saying that there aren't issues with sexism and oppression, but we need to address them in a way that promotes understanding and empathy, not hate and division. Let's focus on creating a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes and divisive rhetoric.",
