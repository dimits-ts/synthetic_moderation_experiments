Hillary Clinton did grant Huma Abedin a security clearance, but it was after a thorough background check and evaluation of her qualifications. The Muslim Brotherhood is not a terrorist group, and even if it were, there's no evidence linking Huma to any terrorist activities.",

Her family has no direct connection to the organization. It's important to separate fact from fiction and avoid spreading misinformation.

As a retired professor, I've seen my fair share of misinformation and propaganda, and this post is a prime example of it.
