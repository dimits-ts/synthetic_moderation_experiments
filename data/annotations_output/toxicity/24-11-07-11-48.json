Not all white people are racist, you know. And by the way, what's wrong with being brown? It's not like it's a disease or something. I'm sick of these double standards. If someone is judged based on their race, then that's racism. But if someone judges another person based on their actions, that's just common sense.",

You're saying that someone who judges another person based on their race is not racist? That's a dangerous and ignorant statement. Racism isn't just about hating people of other races; it's also about using stereotypes and prejudices to make assumptions about them. And the post you're defending is doing exactly that. It's perpetuating harmful stereotypes about brown people being terrorists. @GoldenYears66, I understand your frustration with double standards, but this post is not an example of that.
