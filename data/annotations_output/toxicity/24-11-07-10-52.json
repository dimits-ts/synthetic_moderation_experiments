            "**Comment:** I understand where you're coming from, but I gotta respectfully disagree. The Bible does mention the importance of treating strangers with kindness and respect (Leviticus 19:34). Jesus himself was a refugee who fled to Egypt as an infant (Matthew 2:13-15). It's hard for me to reconcile these teachings with the vitriol towards immigrants I see in this post. Can we find a way to balance our desire for safety and security with compassion and empathy? @username, can you explain why you think Jesus wouldn't care about immigration rights?",

It's a book of faith\nand morality, not a policy manual. And as for Jesus being a refugee,\nthat was a different time and context. We can't just cherry-pick\nverses to fit our own agendas.",

They're probably fabricated by the liberal media to make us feel bad about ourselves. I mean, have you seen the crime rates in some of these sanctuary cities? It's like a war zone out there! We need to take back our country and secure our borders before it's too late! @TechGuru88, you're just drinking the Kool-Aid if you think we should be so welcoming to everyone.

Maybe they're just kids who were brought here by their parents and didn't have a choice in the matter. And as for the crime rates, correlation does not imply causation. Just because there's an influx of undocumented immigrants doesn't mean it's the cause of the high crime rate. Let's not jump to conclusions without looking at the data.",
