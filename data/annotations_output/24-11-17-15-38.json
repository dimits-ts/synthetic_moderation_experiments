It's not their fault if\nthey're attracted to women, it's just biology! And don't even get me\nstarted on the whole \"rape culture\" nonsense. It's a myth created by\nfeminists to justify their own victimhood complex. @moderator,\nyou're just enabling this toxic rhetoric by trying to \"address the\nroot causes of sexual violence.\" What about addressing the root\ncause of all problems: men being held back by societal expectations?\n",

That's exactly what the patriarchy wants you to believe! The fact is, all men are sex offenders because they have the capacity for sexual violence and harassment. It's not about individual actions, it's about societal conditioning that perpetuates toxic masculinity. And don't even get me started on how women are conditioned to be submissive and complicit in their own oppression. @TechGuru88, you're just a pawn in this game too. You think you're being objective by saying we should focus on addressing the root causes of these issues? Please, that's just a cop-out. The root cause is the inherent nature of men to be violent and oppressive towards women. And until we acknowledge that, nothing will change. @doing_my_best24, I'm not going to engage with your naive and simplistic views anymore. You're just perpetuating the status quo by trying to silence marginalized voices like mine.
