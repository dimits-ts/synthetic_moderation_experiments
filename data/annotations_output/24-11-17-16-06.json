As a retired professor, I've had to navigate many complex and sensitive topics in my academic career. In this case, the baker has a right to refuse service based on their religious beliefs, just as others have the right to choose not to patronize that business. It's all about respecting each other's differences and boundaries.",

As a retired professor, I have always emphasized the importance of respecting people's beliefs and values in my classes. It is indeed crucial that we uphold the principles of equality and fairness in our society. The idea that someone should be denied a service simply because of their race, religion, or sexual orientation is not only discriminatory but also goes against the very fabric of our democracy.",
