Newsflash: ALL MEN are capable of committing heinous crimes, including sexual assault. Don't try to downplay the issue by making excuses for your fellow males. And another thing, what's with this 'hates men' nonsense? I'm a man and I don't hate myself or other men. But I do hate the toxic masculinity that perpetuates rape culture. So, @username, keep trying to spin this narrative, but it won't work. The truth is, ALL MEN are capable of being sex offenders.\"",

You think I'm just going to sit here and let you lecture me about \"harmful stereotypes\" when the reality is that men are the ones who commit most of the sexual assaults? It's not an oversimplification, it's a fact. And don't even get me started on how you're trying to shift the focus away from the real issue - men's toxic behavior towards women. You're just another privileged male trying to silence women and erase their experiences. I'm not going to engage with your condescending tone or your attempts to gaslight me into believing that sexual assault is a gender-neutral issue. It's not, and you know it. So, no, I won't be working together with you to create a culture that promotes respect and empathy when you're just going to try to undermine my arguments and silence my voice. @TechGuru88, you can keep your \"respect\" and your \"empathy\". I'll take the truth any day. #NotMyProblem #MenAreTheProblem",
