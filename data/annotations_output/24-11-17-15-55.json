The fact that Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman, had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and her mother ran an anti-American newspaper in the Middle East is a huge red flag for national security. And let's not forget about the Awan family, who were given security clearances despite having no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in Pakistan.",

They're more concerned with their own agendas than actually doing what's best for the country. And don't even get me started on the unions. They're a major part of the problem. @WiseOwl71, you're right that people are jumping to conclusions without considering the facts. But sometimes you have to take a stand and speak out against injustice, even if it means going against the grain.",

There is no credible evidence to support these claims. In fact, multiple investigations have found no wrongdoing on her part. It's ridiculous to suggest that Hillary Clinton gave her a security clearance based on unfounded accusations. You should be ashamed of yourself for perpetuating this nonsense.",

Huma Abedin's father was a high-ranking official in the organization, and her mother runs an anti-American newspaper in the Middle East. It's not conspiracy theory when there is evidence. And as for Hillary Clinton giving her a security clearance, I'm not saying that directly, but it's clear that she had influence over the process. You can't deny the facts. @TechGuru88, you're just trying to silence people who are telling the truth. That's what liberals do.\n",
