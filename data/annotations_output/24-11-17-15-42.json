            "\"Are you kidding me? This is a free country, right? I can refuse to sell someone a cake for any reason I want. If they're going to get all bent out of shape about it, maybe they should just bake their own damn cake! And another thing, what's with the 'it's discrimination' nonsense? Discrimination is when you treat people unfairly based on their race, gender, or religion. Refusing to sell a cake because someone wants to use it in a gay wedding isn't discrimination, it's just good business sense. If I'm going to lose customers and get harassed by the PC police for doing something that goes against my beliefs, then maybe I should just shut down my bakery altogether! And as for your little jab about Catholics worshipping Mary and bread, well, let me tell you, we're not 'worshipping' anything, we're just showing reverence to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So, @CatholicHater, get over yourself!\"",

The original post is about discrimination and refusing to sell someone something based on their beliefs or preferences. I understand that people have different opinions and beliefs, but when it comes to business, shouldn't there be some kind of standard? Like, if a store refuses to serve someone because of their race, religion, or sexual orientation, isn't that illegal? I'm not saying we should just agree with everyone's opinion, but shouldn't we at least try to understand where they're coming from?",
