            "I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the fact that Jesus was an immigrant himself. He was born in Bethlehem, which is outside of Israel, and he had to flee to Egypt with his family when King Herod ordered the massacre of all the male children in Bethlehem. So, it's ironic that some people use the Bible to justify anti-immigrant sentiments. It's important to remember that Jesus' own story is one of migration and displacement, and we should be more compassionate towards those who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families.",

As a retired professor with a PhD in biblical studies, I must correct you - Jesus did indeed speak about the treatment of foreigners and strangers in his teachings. In fact, he emphasized the importance of showing compassion and kindness towards those who are marginalized and vulnerable.",

It's ridiculous to try to use the Bible as a tool for political propaganda or to justify hatred towards others. The post is not only divisive but also misinformed. We should focus on understanding each other's perspectives rather than trying to score cheap points with inflammatory rhetoric.",
