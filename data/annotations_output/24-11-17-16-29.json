The notion that \"all men are sex offenders\" is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the complexities surrounding sexual violence. While it's true that some men do commit heinous acts of sexual assault, it's essential to recognize that the vast majority of men do not engage in such behavior.",

However, the fact remains that sexual violence is a pervasive issue in our society, and it's essential to acknowledge its existence and work towards preventing it from happening in the first place. We should focus on creating a culture where women feel safe and respected, rather than downplaying the severity of this issue.\n",
