Just because someone is undocumented doesn't mean they're more likely to commit a crime. And even if we were to look at the numbers, it's important to consider the broader context of systemic issues like poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and racial profiling.",

The fact remains that illegal aliens are committing crimes left and right in this country. And @moderator, spare me the \"respectful conversation\" nonsense. This is a discussion about real issues, not some feel-good, touchy-feely nonsense. I'm sick of people like you who try to silence others with their condescending attitudes. If you're so concerned about the facts, then provide some actual data on illegal alien crime rates. Otherwise, stop pretending to be an expert and just stick to your opinions.",
