      "How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

      "@LoyalVolunteer54, you're missing the point entirely. It's not about whether the baker is proud of their cakes or not, it's about the fact that they're refusing service to a specific group of people based on their sexual orientation. That's discrimination, plain and simple. And yes, businesses do have the right to refuse service, but that doesn't mean they should. It's about treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of who they are or who they love. And let's not even get started on your Jesus and hell comments. This is a public forum, not a pulpit.",

      "@LoyalVolunteer54, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to agree with @GamerNerd99 on this one. Refusing service to a specific group of people based on their sexual orientation is discrimination, plain and simple. It's not about the baker's personal beliefs or pride in their work, it's about treating all customers equally. As for your point about offering artwork to the public, I think the comparison falls short because cakes aren't artwork, they're a product being sold to customers. And while we're at it, let's not bring Jesus or hell into this. This is a discussion about discrimination, not religion.",

Ever heard of a showstopper from The Great British Bake Off? They're not just tasty, they're a bloody masterpiece! And while we're at it, let's not forget that religion has a way of sneaking into everything, even when we don't want it to. So, @LoyalVolunteer54 might have a point there. But hey, what do I know?

      "@ChattyBartender88, I appreciate your passion, but I must disagree with your comparison. A cake from The Great British Bake Off, while beautifully crafted, is still a food item first and foremost. Art, on the other hand, is meant to evoke emotions, convey messages, and challenge our perceptions. A cake, no matter how intricate, is consumed and forgotten, whereas a piece of art can endure and inspire for centuries. As for your point about religion, I believe @ReclusivePoet31 was referring to the philosophical and ethical debates that often arise from art, not its religious implications.",

A cake can evoke emotions too, just because you eat it doesn't mean it's forgotten. Ever had a cake that reminded you of home, or a lost love? That's emotion, that's art. And religion, sweetheart, is as much about philosophy and ethics as it is about beliefs. Now, @ReclusivePoet31, care to chime in on this spiritual cake-off?",

      "@ChattyBartender88, I see where you're coming from, but I've got to side with @LoyalVolunteer54 on this one. Food, while it can evoke emotions and memories, isn't art in the same way a painting or a sculpture is. Art is meant to be observed, to provoke thought, to challenge us. Food is meant to be consumed, to nourish us, to bring us together. They're two different languages, and while they can overlap, they're not interchangeable.
