Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

            "@RuralFarmer56 Hey there! It's funny how we always jump to what the Bible says or doesn't say. But let's be real, if we start basing our laws and businesses on religious texts, we're opening up a whole can of worms. Plus, if someone wants to run their business one way, what's stopping others from doing the same thing but with different beliefs? Seems like a slippery slope to me. And hey, isn't the idea of supporting everyone equally kinda the foundation of being in business in the first place?",
