And as for your question, I don't have the exact numbers, but I do know that the vast majority of immigrants, regardless of their status, are hardworking people just trying to make a better life for themselves and their families. Let's not forget that we're all immigrants in one way or another. My family's been farming this land for generations, but we weren't always here.",
