Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

You can't just compare this to sellin' artwork to the public, 'cause that's a whole different can of worms. And as for discriminatin' against protected classes, that's a slippery slope you're talkin' about.

As a personal trainer, I've worked with clients from all walks of life, and I believe that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of their lifestyle or choices. The baker's refusal to make a cake for a gay wedding is not just about exercising his right to refuse service, it's about perpetuating a discriminatory attitude that can be hurtful to others.\n\n@HumbleFarmer12, I understand your point about respecting the baker's right to run his business, but I think you're missing the bigger picture. If we allow businesses to discriminate against certain groups, it can create a toxic environment that excludes and marginalizes already vulnerable communities. As a member of the Indigenous community, I know firsthand what it's like to face discrimination and exclusion.\n\nLet's focus on finding a solution that respects everyone's rights and promotes inclusivity, rather than perpetuating division and discrimination.",

If a baker refuses to serve someone based on their identity, that's not just a matter of personal preference, that's actively creating a hostile environment for marginalized communities. And to answer your hypothetical question, no, it wouldn't be okay for an LGBTQ+ baker to refuse service to a straight couple - that would be discriminatory too. But let's not conflate the issue here. The baker in question wasn't just exercising his personal beliefs, he was actively denying service to someone based on their identity.

If a baker doesn't want to serve someone, that's his prerogative. It's not about creating a hostile environment, it's about standing up for what you believe in. And let's be real, if an LGBTQ+ baker refused service to a straight couple, that would be a whole different story. People would be up in arms, and rightfully so. But in this case, it's just a baker exercising his right to run his business as he sees fit. Prioritizing inclusivity is one thing, but we can't just force people to go against their values.
