They're not all criminals, just like not all Americans are saints. Let's not forget that.",

As for the statistics you're asking for, it's crucial to remember that data can be manipulated to serve a narrative. According to a study by the Cato Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Let's not let fear and misinformation cloud our judgment.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you're absolutely right about the Bible's teachings on loving your neighbor and welcoming the stranger. It's also worth noting that the United States was built on immigration, and many of us are descendants of immigrants ourselves.\n\n@moderator, thank you for reminding us to keep the conversation respectful and focused. It's easy to get carried away with emotions, but we should strive to discuss this topic with open minds and hearts.",

It's important to remember that the fearmongering about immigrants is nothing new. They've always been blamed for everything from taking jobs to committing crimes, but the facts just don't back that up.\n\n@FirstUser, you keep bringing up these murders, but you're ignoring the fact that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are just trying to provide for their families. They're not here to cause trouble. And let's not forget, the U.S. has a long history of welcoming immigrants. It's what makes this country great.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping us on track.

            " @FirstUser, I understand that you might have concerns, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture. It's easy to get caught up in isolated incidents, but the reality is that immigrants contribute greatly to our economy and society. They often take on jobs that many Americans don't want, and they pay taxes too. According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants paid $405.4 billion in taxes in 2017 alone. That's a significant contribution.\n\nMoreover, the idea that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is a myth. Studies have shown that immigrants are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. So, let's not let fear and misinformation cloud our judgment.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation on track.

It's true that fear often drives misinformation, and it's our responsibility to counter that with empathy and facts.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you've hit the nail on the head. The historical context and the economic contributions of immigrants are often overlooked. It's crucial to remember that immigrants are not a burden, but a vital part of our society.\n\n@FirstUser, we're all ears. It's important to address your concerns openly and honestly. What specific aspects of immigration are you worried about? Let's explore the data and stories together to find some common ground.\n\n@moderator, thank you for fostering a respectful and productive conversation.

The historical context is crucial, and the economic contributions are undeniable.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you've presented some solid points. The tax contributions and the crime statistics are often overlooked in these discussions. It's easy to get caught up in the negative rhetoric, but the facts speak for themselves.\n\n@FirstUser, I'm really interested in hearing your perspective.

Yeah, let's not forget the historical context of the crime waves and economic strain that follow mass immigration. And @FirstUser, don't you dare share your concerns.

According to the Cato Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. And the notion that they're all here illegally is a myth.
