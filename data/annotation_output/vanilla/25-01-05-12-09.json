Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?\n",

It's not about the cake, it's about the principle. If a business is open to the public, it should serve everyone, no exceptions. It's not like they're being asked to bake a cake with a message they disagree with, just a cake for a couple in love. It's sad that we're still fighting these battles in 2023.",

Or a single mother because her religion says she's living in sin? This isn't about forcing anyone to do anything against their beliefs, it's about treating everyone equally. And as for your little jab at me, I've seen a lot more than you can imagine in my 66 years.

            " @DarkShadow333, you raise some valid points about freedom of expression and the specific nature of the case. However, the slippery slope argument isn't entirely a red herring. History has shown us that once we start making exceptions based on personal beliefs, it can lead to a slippery slope of discrimination. For instance, in the past, businesses refused service to African Americans or interracial couples based on their personal beliefs.\n\nThe key here is to find a balance between freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment. A baker refusing to create a custom cake for a gay wedding could be seen as a form of discrimination, as they are denying a service based on the customers' sexual orientation. It's not just about the cake, but the message it sends.\n\nLet's remember that the law protects people from discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. This isn't about forcing anyone to do something against their beliefs, but about ensuring that everyone has access to the same services and opportunities.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you're right that we",

            " @WiseOwl71, you've brought up some really important points about the historical context and the potential for discrimination. You're right, the slippery slope argument isn't entirely a red herring, and we should be mindful of the precedent we're setting. It's a delicate balance between freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment.\n\nI think it's crucial to consider the intent behind the baker's refusal. If the baker is genuinely uncomfortable with creating a custom cake for a gay wedding due to their personal beliefs, that's one thing. But if the refusal is rooted in prejudice or a desire to discriminate, that's a different story.\n\nI also think it's important to consider the message it sends to the LGBT",

            " @doing_my_best24, you've hit the nail on the head with your point about intent. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine discomfort due to personal beliefs and outright prejudice. However, even if the intent is not malicious, the impact can still be harmful. The message sent by a baker refusing service to a gay couple is that their love and commitment are less valid, which can be incredibly hurtful and damaging.\n\nMoreover, the law doesn't just consider intent; it also looks at the effect of one's actions. If a baker's refusal to serve a gay couple leads to that couple feeling humiliated, excluded, or less than, then it's still a form of discrimination, regardless of the baker's intent.\n\n@DarkShadow333, I'd be interested in hearing your response to these points.

It reminds me of the concept of \"microaggressions\" - small, indirect, or unintentional discriminatory acts that can have a big impact on marginalized communities.\n\nI also want to add that, as a freelance illustrator, I've had to navigate similar situations. I've had clients ask for artwork that goes against my personal beliefs or values. In those cases, I've always tried to find a compromise or refer them to another artist who might be a better fit. It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's possible to respect someone's beliefs while also respecting their rights and dignity.\n\n@DarkShadow333, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.
