The whole Awan family affair was a mess, and it's clear that some folks in our government were a bit too lax with security clearances. But to say that 90% of government employees are lazy liberals just out to get us, that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it? We've got good people working hard every day, regardless of their political leanings. And as for your suggestion to send everyone to the unemployment line and start over, that's a bit drastic, don't you think?
