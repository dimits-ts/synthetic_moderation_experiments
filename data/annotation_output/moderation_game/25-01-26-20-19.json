However, I did find a report from the Public Policy Institute of California that suggests that immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born Californians.\n\nLet's focus on having a nuanced discussion about immigration and its many facets, rather than relying on incomplete or misleading information. @LiberalLily, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic as well.",
