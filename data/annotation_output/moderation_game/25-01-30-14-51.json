            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            "@doing_my_best24, I see you're at it again, spewing conspiracy theories and misinformation. Let's get some facts straight. Huma Abedin's security clearance was thoroughly vetted by the FBI, and there's no credible evidence linking her to terrorist groups. And as for the Awan family, they were investigated by the FBI and cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nYour rant about government employees being lazy and liberal is just that - a rant. It's not based on any facts or evidence. And by the way, union contracts are in place to protect workers' rights, not to coddle them. You can't just negate them and start over again. That's not how it works.\n\nI'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your lack of understanding of how government works. Maybe you should take a civics class or two before spouting off about things you clearly don't know much about.",
