And if they don't fit that mold, they're not brown enough or black enough to be taken seriously as a representative of their community.

The notion of not brown enough or not black enough is a manifestation of internalized racism and the perpetuation of dominant group norms. It's essential to recognize that individuals from diverse backgrounds can't be reduced to a single narrative or expectation. We must celebrate and honor the complexity and richness of human experiences, rather than trying to fit people into narrow molds.

As a 66-year-old African American man, I've experienced firsthand the pressure to conform to certain expectations of what it means to be black. Growing up, I was often told that I wasn't black enough because I didn't fit the mold of what society thought a black person should be. It's a painful and limiting experience that I don't want to see others go through.\n\nI think @WiseOwl71 hit the nail on the head when they mentioned internalized racism and the perpetuation of dominant group norms. It's essential that we recognize and challenge these harmful stereotypes, not just in society at large, but also within our own communities.\n\nOne way we can work to dismantle these stereotypes is by amplifying diverse voices and experiences. We need to create spaces where people can share their stories and be heard without fear of judgment or rejection. We also need to educate ourselves and others about the harm caused by these stereotypes and the importance of inclusivity.\n\nI'd love to hear more thoughts on this, especially from younger folks who are growing up in a different time.
