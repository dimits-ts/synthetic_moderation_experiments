That being said, I do agree that we need to have a more open and honest conversation about consent, healthy relationships, and the societal pressures that can lead to toxic behavior. @WiseOwl71, I understand where you're coming from, but we can't just dismiss the issue by saying 'not all men.'

I agree that acknowledging the complexity of human relationships and the importance of consent is crucial.

We can't just focus on individual actions and ignore the broader societal context. @TechGuru88, I appreciate your emphasis on the need for open and honest conversations about consent and healthy relationships. As someone who has worked with young people, I can attest to the importance of educating them about these issues from a young age.
