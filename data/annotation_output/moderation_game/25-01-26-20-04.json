The original statement might have been misinterpreted or taken out of context. It's essential to acknowledge that not all men are sex offenders, and it's unfair to generalize an entire group based on the actions of a few.\n\nHowever, we also need to recognize that there is a significant issue with sexual assault and harassment in our society. It's crucial that we create a safe space for victims to share their stories and for us to listen and learn from them.\n\nLet's focus on promoting healthy and respectful relationships, rather than jumping to conclusions or making assumptions about individuals.
