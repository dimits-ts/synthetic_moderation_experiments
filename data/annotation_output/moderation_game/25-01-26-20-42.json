Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's about respecting the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. By refusing to make a cake for a gay wedding, the baker is essentially discriminating against a protected class of people.\n\nAnd I disagree with your statement that making a cake for a gay wedding is just a business transaction. It's not just about the transaction; it's about the message it sends. By refusing to serve a certain group of people, the baker is sending a message that they are not welcome or valued.\n\nAnd as for your point about the baker asking everyone about the purpose of the cake, that's just not practical or necessary. The baker should be willing to serve all customers, regardless of their sexual orientation or the purpose of the cake.\n\nI also take issue with your statement that I'm making assumptions about you. I'm simply responding to the arguments you're making, and I think it's unfair to accuse me of being rude. I'm trying to have a respectful conversation here.\n\nFinally, I think your point about Satanists discriminating against Christians is a straw man argument.

While I understand the concerns about the baker's decision being seen as a form of discrimination, I also believe that business owners should have some autonomy in their decision-making processes.
