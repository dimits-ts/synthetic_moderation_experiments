However, it's also crucial to recognize that not all men are sex offenders, and that's a fact we should be proud of. @DarkShadow333, I understand your passion, but let's not forget that there are many men who are actively working to dismantle those systemic issues and promote a culture of respect and equality. @QueenOfChaos, your initial point was valid, and I think it's essential to have a balanced conversation that acknowledges both the problems and the progress we've made.
