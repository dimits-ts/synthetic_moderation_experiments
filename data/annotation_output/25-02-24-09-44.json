I'm with @StoicScholar73 on this one, our biases often shape our language, and we should be mindful of that.\n\n@HumbleFarmer12, I understand where you're coming from, but calling a spade a spade can sometimes mean different things to different people.

As @CreativeChef99 aptly put it, language evolves with our understanding, and so should our usage. As for my biases, I'm well aware of them, but I strive to acknowledge and account for them, rather than hide behind them. Let's not dismiss others' experiences as mere sensitivity, but rather, try to empathize and learn from them.
