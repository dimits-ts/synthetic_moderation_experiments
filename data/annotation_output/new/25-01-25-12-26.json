If a business can refuse service to someone based on their sexual orientation, where does it stop? What about race, religion, or any other characteristic? It's a slippery slope. And yes, people do choose their religion, but that doesn't make it any less a part of who they are. Would you be comfortable with a bakery refusing to sell you a cake because you're an atheist? It's the same principle. As for being a liberal snowflake, I'm a retired professor who's seen more of the world than you can imagine. I'm not easily offended, but I am offended by discrimination.
