This is not in line with our community guidelines.\n\nLet's address your points:\n\n1. Everyone has the right to express their feelings and preferences, but it's important to do so respectfully. Name-calling and dismissing others' experiences as pushing an agenda is not productive.\n\n2. The topic of public displays of affection is a valid one, but it's important to discuss it respectfully. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable and safe in public spaces.\n\n3. The comparison you made is not accurate. Consensual relationships between adults are not comparable to human-animal relationships.\n\n4. As a moderator, my role is to ensure that our conversations remain respectful and inclusive. If you have concerns about your work situation, there are other platforms and resources that might be more suitable for that discussion.\n\nPlease refrain from using derogatory language and dismissive attitudes.

It's just two people expressing their love, just like you might with your partner. As for your dog, that's a completely different scenario. Animals can't consent, and that's a whole other can of worms.
