Not just the birds and the bees, but real discussions about boundaries, respect, and consent. And it shouldn't be a one-time thing, but an ongoing conversation.\n\nAdditionally, we need to challenge toxic masculinity and promote healthy expressions of masculinity. This can be done through media representation, public campaigns, and even in our daily interactions.\n\nLastly, we need to support survivors and hold perpetrators accountable. This includes believing survivors, providing resources for healing, and ensuring that justice is served.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you're right that false accusations can happen, but they're statistically rare. Let's not use that as an excuse to dismiss the very real experiences of survivors. And yes, men can be victims too, but that doesn't negate the fact that women are disproportionately affected.

It's a sad state of affairs when a man can't even compliment a woman without fear of being accused of harassment. And @TechGuru88, don't even get me started on the whole 'toxic masculinity' nonsense. It's just another way to shame men for being men. Let's not forget, men have feelings too, and it's not 'toxic' to express them. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a lowly retail worker.

But to say that women are devils in disguise is a bit of a stretch and doesn't help the conversation. Toxic masculinity isn't about shaming men for being men, but rather challenging the harmful aspects of traditional masculinity that can lead to issues like sexual harassment and violence. It's about promoting healthier expressions of masculinity that allow men to express their feelings and be true to themselves. As for your degree, it's not about that.
