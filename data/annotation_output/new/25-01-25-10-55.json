Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

As an artist, I know how personal our work can be, and when we create something for someone, it's a form of expression and support. By refusing to make a cake for a gay wedding, the baker is essentially saying that he doesn't support or approve of gay marriages, which is hurtful and discriminatory.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, you're right that it's just a cake, but it's also a symbol.
