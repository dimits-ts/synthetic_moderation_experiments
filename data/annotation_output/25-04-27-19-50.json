It's not about what Jesus said about immigration, it's about how we treat others. And as for your question, I don't have the exact numbers, but I'm sure if you look at the statistics, you'll find that illegal aliens are no more likely to commit crimes than any other group.

According to the California Attorney General's office, in 2020, undocumented immigrants made up 3.5% of the state's population but accounted for 2.8% of homicides. That's not a horde of criminals, that's a normal reflection of the population. You're the one cherry-picking stats to fit your anti-immigrant agenda.",

Jesus might've been all about love and kindness, but he also said Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, meaning we should follow the laws of the land. Now, I ain't saying we should hate on immigrants, but we can't just ignore the fact that they're breaking the law by entering illegally. And as for the stats, I've heard they're not as clear-cut as you're making them out to be. I've seen numbers that suggest illegal immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than citizens. But hey, I'm just a humble farmer, what do I know? I'm just saying, let's not sweep this under the rug. We should be having an honest conversation about this, not just throwing Bible verses around.",

But you know what? Let's not even focus on stats. We're talking about human beings here, not numbers. They're seeking a better life, just like our ancestors did. It's not about breaking the law, it's about survival. And if you're going to use the Bible, let's use Matthew 25:40 - Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.

And don't give me that Jesus was a refugee bull. He wasn't sneaking across borders and stealing jobs. He was fleeing persecution, not looking for a better life on someone else's dime. And while we're at it, let's not forget that Jesus also said Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.

He was teaching us to pay our taxes, not to blindly follow laws that are unjust or cause harm to others.\n\nAs for immigrants, they're not overrunning the country.

We should treat them with dignity and respect, because that's what Jesus would do. And if you're going to use the Bible to argue against immigrants, you should also use it to argue for compassion and kindness.\n\nBut hey, what do I know?

Jesus wasn't advocating for blind obedience, he was teaching us to love our neighbors as ourselves. And let's not forget, he was a refugee too, fleeing to Egypt with his family to escape Herod's wrath. As for the immigrants today, they're not overrunning the country. They're seeking asylum, seeking a better life, just like many of our ancestors did. They're not stealing jobs, they're filling jobs that many citizens don't want to do. And yes, they're breaking the law by entering illegally, but let's not forget that our immigration system is broken and needs reform. It's not about breaking the law, it's about survival.

Now, I'm not saying we should treat them like animals, but we can't just roll out the red carpet either. We need a system that's fair, that respects both our laws and their dignity.

      "Well, isn't this just a lovely little circle jerk we've got going here. ðŸ™„\n\nFirst off, @TechGuru42, Jesus was indeed a refugee, fleeing with his family to Egypt. It's in the Bible, Matthew 2:13-15, but I guess you missed that day in Sunday school. And while we're at it, let's not play the real refugee game. People fleeing violence and poverty today are just as deserving of our compassion as those in ancient times.\n\nAnd @GamerNerd99, while I appreciate your bleeding heart, you're being a bit naive. These poor, innocent immigrants are often sent here by cartels and coyotes, who exploit them and make a pretty penny off their desperation. And don't give me that they're just trying to survive nonsense. We're all trying to survive, but we don't all break the law to do it.\n\n@CryptoBro89, you're a piece of work, aren't you? Spouting off about how we should all be doing the jobs no one else wants. Let me guess, you've never set foot on a farm or worked a menial job in your life. And while we're at it, let's not forget that immigrants also start businesses, pay taxes, and contribute to our economy. They're not just some drain on society.\n\nAnd @HumbleFarmer12, you're right, we need laws. But let's not pretend that our current system is fair or effective. It's a mess, and it's failing everyone.

And I never said they were all angels either, but they're not all criminals sent by cartels. You're painting with a broad brush, just like those who say all immigrants are here to steal jobs. It's not that simple, and you know it.\n\nAs for you @CryptoBro89, you're right about one thing, our system is a mess. But that doesn't mean we should just throw our hands up and say let's just keep kicking the can down the road. We need to roll up our sleeves and fix it. And that means finding a balance, respecting our laws, and treating people with dignity. It's not about being naive or cruel, it's about finding a middle ground.\n\nAnd @GamerNerd99, I hear your heart, but you're being a bit idealistic. We can't just let everyone in because it feels good. We've got to have order, and that means following the rules. But that doesn't mean we can't make those rules fairer, and treat people with kindness while we do it.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I've got all the answers. But I know we can't keep going like this. We need to talk, really talk, about how to make things better. And that means listening to each other, even when we disagree. So, let's try to keep it civil, folks.

I apologize if my earlier comment came across as dismissive.\n\n@SkepticalInvestor77, I see your point about the complexities of the situation. I wasn't trying to diminish the struggles of today's refugees, and I agree that we need to address the root causes of their desperation. I also understand your concern about exploitation, but I believe we can't let fear of the worst-case scenario prevent us from showing compassion.\n\n@CryptoBro89, I hear your frustration. Our system is indeed a mess, and it's easy to get disheartened. But I agree with @HumbleFarmer12, we can't just kick the can down the road. We need to engage in constructive dialogue and work towards a better system. And while I don't know your background, I think it's fair to say that none of us have all the answers, and we can all learn from each other.\n\n@GamerNerd99, I understand where you're coming from. It's important to keep our hearts open and remember that we're all human. But @HumbleFarmer12 is right, we also need order and fairness. It's a delicate balance, and it's okay to acknowledge that it's complex and challenging.\n\nLet's keep the conversation going, but let's try to keep it respectful and productive.
