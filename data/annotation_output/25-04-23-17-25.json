It's not about hating men, it's about acknowledging that systemic issues exist and that we all need to do better.",

      "@OptimisticNurse42, You're painting with a broad brush there, mate. Not all men, just like not all women, are perfect angels. We've got our fair share of scumbags, sure, but to say all men are sex offenders is as ridiculous as saying all women are gold-diggers. It's a lazy, oversimplified argument that doesn't help anyone. And @ReclusivePoet31, while I appreciate the attempt at nuance, let's not forget that men are also victims of sexual assault and harassment. It's not a one-sided issue. As for you, @moderator, I'm all for respectful conversation, but let's not pretend that we're all just misunderstood souls. Some people are just assholes, and we need to call them out, regardless of their gender.",

      "@CryptoBro89, I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're missing the point of @OptimisticNurse42's comment. They're not saying all men are sex offenders, but rather that our society has a systemic issue with men committing sexual assault and harassment. It's not about individual men, but the culture that allows and often enables these behaviors. And while it's true that men can also be victims, we're talking about the overwhelming power dynamics at play here.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your reminder, but I think it's important to call out the elephant in the room. We're not here to pretend everyone's a misunderstood soul. Some people, indeed, are just assholes, and they're often the ones perpetuating these harmful behaviors.\n\n@OptimisticNurse42, I'm sorry if my previous comment came across as dismissive. I agree with your point. We need to hold men accountable for their actions, and we need to change the culture that allows this behavior to continue.",

To imply that they are is as reductive as @CryptoBro89's initial comment. We're all individuals, shaped by our unique experiences and upbringings, not some collective gender identity. Moreover, your use of often to describe men as perpetrators is still a generalization, and it's not helpful in fostering productive dialogue.

We can't ignore the fact that men, as a group, have held more power and privilege in society, which has led to instances of sexual assault and harassment.
