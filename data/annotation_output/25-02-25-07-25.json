By not brown enough, I mean that if a suspect doesn't fit the typical profile of a brown-skinned Muslim, they're often given the benefit of the doubt. Take the Boston Marathon bombing, for instance. The initial suspects were a group of white, college-aged males, not the brown-skinned Muslim profile we're so used to hearing about. It took days for Tamerlan Tsarnaev to be identified, despite his Chechen heritage. So, yes, it's not *just* about skin color, but it's certainly a factor.",
