A cake, much like a painting or a sculpture, can be seen as an extension of the artist's personal beliefs and values. To force the baker to create a cake for a same-sex wedding, when their religious beliefs disagree with such unions, could be seen as an infringement on their artistic freedom.\n\nBut, as you've rightly pointed out, there's a balance to be struck between artistic expression and the right to service. Perhaps a compromise could be found, where the baker is not forced to create a cake for a wedding they disagree with, but they must provide other services or products to all customers without discrimination.\n\n@HistoryBuff99, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this compromise.

As for your compromise, it's a start, but it still forces the baker to choose between their beliefs and their livelihood.
