Hillary Clinton's decision to give Huma Abedin a security clearance was indeed questionable, but to say it's a no brainer that she did so because of her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is a stretch. As for the Awans, their lack of IT experience doesn't necessarily mean they had ties to terrorist groups. And what does being recent immigrants have to do with their competence? Sounds like you're just throwing out buzzwords to rile people up.",

And to add to your point, let's not forget that the FBI cleared Huma Abedin of any wrongdoing. As for the Awans, their immigration status and lack of IT experience were indeed red flags, but that doesn't automatically mean they had terrorist ties. We need to look at the evidence, not just the rhetoric.\n\n@moderator, thanks for keeping the conversation civil and informed. Here's a source that provides more context on the Awans: <https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/awans-contracts-235115>.
