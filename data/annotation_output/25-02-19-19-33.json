            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

And let's not forget, it was a Republican president who hired the Awan family. You can't just blame one side. Plus, security clearances aren't given based on political affiliation or family ties, but on trustworthiness and loyalty.",

            "@RuralFarmer56, I appreciate your perspective, but you're missing the bigger picture here. It's not about individual liberals being incompetent or lazy, it's about the systemic issues that arise when political agendas dictate hiring and clearance decisions. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, did indeed give Huma Abedin a security clearance despite her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. And yes, it was a Republican president who hired the Awan family, but it was under a Democrat-led Congress that they were given security clearances and allowed to access sensitive information. It's not about blame, it's about accountability. Our government needs to prioritize national security over political connections and personal agendas. And yes, security clearances should be based on trustworthiness and loyalty, but how can we trust these decisions when they're clearly influenced by politics? As for your suggestion that we start over with non-unionized public employees, I think that's a step in the right direction. Unions often protect incompetent employees and hinder productivity. Let's not forget, it's the taxpayers' money that's being spent here, and they deserve a government that works for them, not against them.",

Both sides play the game, and it's not as simple as national security over political connections. If that were the case, we wouldn't be in this mess. And let's not act like unions are the root of all evil. They exist to protect workers' rights, and without them, we'd have even more exploitation. Plus, you're cherry-picking examples. There are plenty of instances where Republicans have done the same thing, but you conveniently left those out. It's not about blame, you say? Then let's not play the blame game. Let's talk about solutions. Like maybe, just maybe, having a non-partisan body oversee security clearances. But hey, what do I know?
