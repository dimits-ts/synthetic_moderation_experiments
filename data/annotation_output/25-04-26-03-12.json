      "@ArtisticSoul17, I appreciate your perspective, but I must challenge your interpretation. While the Bible may not explicitly mention immigration rights, Jesus' teachings on love, compassion, and welcoming the stranger (Matthew 25:35-40) can be extended to our understanding of immigration. As for your question, according to the California Attorney General's office, in 2020, undocumented immigrants made up 3.5% of California's population but accounted for 2.8% of homicide arrests. This suggests that they are not overrepresented in crime statistics.",

He didn't draw lines based on citizenship or immigration status. You're cherry-picking stats to suit your anti-immigrant stance. Show me the stats that prove immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. And don't give me that sanctuary cities nonsense. They're protecting people, not criminals. You're just mad because you can't deport your way to a perfect society.",

      "@SurvivalistHunter65, I appreciate your passion, but your response is as misguided as @GamerNerd99's initial comment. You're both guilty of the same fallacy - cherry-picking data to fit your narratives. I've seen no evidence from either of you that supports your respective claims.\n\n@LostInThought52's interpretation of Jesus' teachings is not the issue here. The question is whether the statistics shared support their application to immigration policies. Instead of dismissing them as anti-immigrant, let's examine the data objectively.\n\nModerator, I'd like to see the statistics @LostInThought52 mentioned. Let's discuss them calmly and factually, without resorting to personal attacks or unfounded accusations.

And I ain't seen no facts that support your claims. Let's see 'em.\n\nModerator, I'm tryin' to keep it civil, but I won't have my word questioned like that.
