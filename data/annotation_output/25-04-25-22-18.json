      "@QuietThinker92, I understand your perspective, but statistics can indeed be misleading when they're taken out of context or used without considering the underlying factors. For instance, if we look at the statistics on race and terrorism, we might see a higher proportion of individuals from certain backgrounds involved. However, this doesn't necessarily mean there's a causal link between race and terrorism. It could be due to socioeconomic factors, historical injustices, or even biased policing practices that lead to overrepresentation in data.\n\nMoreover, statistics can be manipulated or cherry-picked to support a particular narrative. For example, if we only look at the number of terrorist attacks committed by individuals from certain backgrounds, but ignore the vast majority of attacks committed by individuals from other backgrounds, we're painting an incomplete and potentially misleading picture.\n\nI'm not saying we should ignore these statistics, but we should approach them with a critical eye and consider the broader context.

It's the same with real-world data. Stats can provide valuable insights, but they're just one piece of the puzzle.

We've seen this time and time again in politics, science, and business. So while they can be useful, they're not neutral. We should be wary of those who put too much stock in them, or worse, use them to silence other perspectives.
