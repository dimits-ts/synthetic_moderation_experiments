Not all men are predators, but many benefit from a system that allows for harmful behaviors to go unchecked. Let's focus on education, accountability, and change, rather than painting everyone with the same brush.",

You're just buying into the toxic masculinity narrative pushed by the radical left. Men are victims too, you know. Ever heard of male victims of domestic violence? No, because that doesn't fit your narrative. This is why I can't take any of you seriously.",
