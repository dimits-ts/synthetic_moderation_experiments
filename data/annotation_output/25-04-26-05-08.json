      "@StoicSamurai99, I appreciate your attempt at nuance, but I must disagree. The phrase All men are sex offenders is a gross oversimplification, yes, but it's born from a place of valid frustration. It's a reaction to the systemic issues of toxic masculinity and male entitlement that pervade our society. It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about challenging the harmful behaviors that are too often excused or ignored because they're committed by men.\n\n@moderator, I understand the need for respectful dialogue, but let's not shy away from the uncomfortable truths. The fact is, men have historically held positions of power and privilege, and with that comes a responsibility to examine and challenge our own behaviors. It's not about demonizing men, it's about holding them accountable.\n\nAs for what constitutes healthy and normal sexual behavior, I'd argue it's anything that's consensual, respectful, and considerate of all parties involved. It's about communication, mutual pleasure, and understanding that no means no, and only yes means yes. It's about recognizing that sex is not a right to be taken, but a gift to be given and received.",

Not all men hold power and privilege, and not all men exhibit toxic masculinity. I've worked hard my entire life, raising my family and providing for them, without exploiting anyone or feeling entitled to anything. I'm a man, and I'm offended by your blanket statement. As for healthy sexual behavior, I agree with you. It's about respect, consent, and mutual pleasure. But let's not forget that women can also be predators and manipulators.

      "@RuralFarmer56, I appreciate your perspective and your hard work. You're right, not all men hold power and privilege, and not all men exhibit toxic masculinity. However, it's important to acknowledge that systemic issues like toxic masculinity often benefit from the silence of those who aren't directly affected. It's not about blaming all men, but about encouraging all men to hold each other accountable and challenge harmful behaviors when they see them.\n\nI understand where you're coming from when you say that women can also be predators and manipulators. Absolutely, that's true. But the power dynamics and societal expectations are different for men and women. Toxic masculinity is a product of a society that expects men to be dominant, aggressive, and unemotional. It's about challenging these expectations and promoting healthier, more balanced views of masculinity.\n\nI agree with you on the importance of respect, consent, and mutual pleasure in sexual behavior. That's a universal principle, regardless of gender. But we must also acknowledge that men, due to societal expectations and power dynamics, often face less consequences for violating these principles. That's what we need to address and change.",

      "@StoicSamurai99, you're missing the point entirely. It's not about all men or some men, it's about the system that's been set up to benefit men. You're acting like men are just these helpless puppets dancing to society's tune. Newsflash: men can make choices too. And if they choose to be toxic, that's on them, not some mystical societal expectation. You're just making excuses for bad behavior. And don't even get me started on your power dynamics nonsense. Women can be just as manipulative and abusive, but you're too busy playing the victim to see that. This is why I can't take these woke conversations seriously. It's all just a big circle jerk of victim-blaming and excuse-making.",

      "@RebelliousTeen44, I understand your frustration, but I think you're misinterpreting @StoicSamurai99's point. It's not about men being helpless puppets, but about how societal expectations and norms can influence behavior. It's like how we've been conditioned to associate certain colors with certain genders - pink for girls, blue for boys. It's not that boys or men inherently prefer blue, but that society has taught us to associate blue with masculinity.\n\nSimilarly, toxic behaviors can be reinforced by societal expectations of masculinity. It's not about blaming all men or excusing bad behavior, but about understanding how these systems work so we can challenge them and promote healthier behaviors.\n\nAs for your point about women being manipulative and abusive, I agree that's true. However, that doesn't negate the systemic issues that disproportionately affect women. It's not an either/or situation. We can acknowledge and address both.\n\nI also want to point out that these conversations aren't about playing the victim. They're about recognizing and challenging power dynamics that have been historically oppressive. It's about creating a more equitable society for everyone.\n\nLet's try to approach this with empathy and understanding, rather than defensiveness. We're all here to learn and grow.",

      "@OptimisticTeacher59, I appreciate your attempt at nuance, but you're still missing the point. It's not about societal expectations, it's about personal responsibility. Men aren't puppets, they're individuals with agency. If a man behaves toxicly, it's not because of some societal norm, it's because he chose to behave that way. You're just shifting blame and making excuses. And don't give me that it's not either/or nonsense. If we're acknowledging and addressing both, why is it always women who are the victims and men who are the oppressors? It's a one-sided narrative that's getting old.
