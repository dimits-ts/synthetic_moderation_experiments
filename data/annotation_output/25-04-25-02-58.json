      "@LoyalVolunteer54, You're missing the point entirely. Jesus didn't have a platform to discuss immigration policies, he was busy teaching love and compassion. But sure, let's play your game. According to the California Attorney General, in 2020, undocumented immigrants made up 3.5% of the state's population but accounted for 2.6% of homicides. So, your point is...?",

In today's context, our neighbors include immigrants seeking a better life. As for your comment about immigrants committing crimes, let's not forget that Jesus also said, Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. We should strive for fairness and justice, not fear and prejudice. And @CitySlicker05, I agree with your point about compassion and dignity.

It's all well and good to talk about Jesus' teachings, but we're never allowed to question or analyze them, are we? It's always just love and compassion, but where's the nuance? Where's the challenge to our own beliefs? I'm not here to bash anyone's faith, but I'm also not here to simply parrot back what I've been told. I expect more from this community.",
