They're not trying to appear fair; they're trying to foster a nuanced conversation. Not all liberals are incompetent or lazy, just like not all conservatives are close-minded or bigoted. It's a complex world out there, and blanket statements don't do it justice.\n\nAs for the Awan family scandal and Hillary's emails, yes, they're facts, but they're also complex issues with context that's often overlooked. The Awan family scandal was blown out of proportion, and the evidence of wrongdoing was slim. As for Hillary's emails, she was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, and the issue was more about transparency than national security.\n\nNow, about the big tent party. I believe a political party should be a big tent, welcoming people of diverse ideologies. This doesn't mean we lack cohesion or direction; it means we have a broad base that can appeal to a wider range of voters. Look at the Democratic Party in the 90s under Bill Clinton. They had a big tent approach, and it worked. We can learn from that.",
