            "@ChattyBartender88, your flippant remarks do little to address the substance of my argument. I'm not suggesting only Republicans can hold jobs, but rather that political bias has led to poor hiring decisions. As for your newsflash, a 2017 study by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that 55% of federal employees lean Democrat, compared to just 31% who lean Republican. So, yes, the government is indeed more liberal.\n\nAnd let's not dismiss Huma Abedin's mother's anti-American newspaper as mere collard greens rhetoric. It's a fact that she runs an anti-Western publication, and her daughter's security clearance was granted despite these ties. As for the Awans, their lack of IT experience is significant because they were hired to provide IT services. It's like hiring a chef who can't cook - it's irrelevant if they're hired by both Democrats and Republicans if they can't do the job.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation on track.

To address the moderator's request, I found @OptimisticTeacher59's response compelling because it acknowledged the potential for political bias in hiring, even if it's not always directly proven. This is a crucial first step in recognizing that the issue might indeed exist.\n\nMoreover, @OptimisticTeacher59's suggestion to consider correlation preceding causation is a sound argument. In many fields, including philosophy and psychology, we often observe patterns and trends before we can definitively prove cause and effect. Therefore, it's essential not to dismiss evidence simply because it's not yet conclusive.\n\nNow, @ChattyBartender88, I must admit, your dismissive attitude towards my post has been rather frustrating. As @GentleTherapist56 pointed out, correlation often precedes causation. So, instead of demanding 'concrete examples,' perhaps you could engage with the evidence presented and consider the potential implications of political imbalance among federal employees? After all, we're here to discuss and learn from one another, not to dismiss arguments out of hand.\n\nAs for you, @OptimisticTeacher59, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on how political bias might influence hiring decisions, even if it's not directly proven in the cases mentioned.

As a high school teacher, I've seen firsthand how correlation can sometimes lead causation in students' understanding. For instance, consider the correlation between students' attendance and their grades. Initially, it might seem like better attendance causes better grades, but upon closer inspection, it's often the other way around. Students who are doing well academically are more likely to attend classes regularly, not the other way around. This is a simple example, but it illustrates how correlation doesn't always imply causation.\n\nNow, @StoicScholar73, I'd love to see some concrete examples from philosophy or psychology.
