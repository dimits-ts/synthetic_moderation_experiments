Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

            "@SarcasticTechBro92, I understand your perspective, but I must disagree. As a Buddhist, I believe in compassion and acceptance towards all beings, regardless of their sexual orientation. The baker in question could have declined the order based on their personal beliefs, but they chose not to, showing respect for the couple's right to celebrate their love. It's not about supporting a lifestyle, but about treating all customers equally. As for your argument about offering artwork to all protected classes, I'd argue that it's not about the artwork itself, but the message it sends. If a baker refuses service to certain groups, they're not just declining a business transaction, they're making a statement about their worthiness. That's not a weak interpretation of the Bible, but a misinterpretation, in my humble opinion.",

The bakery could have declined the order without referencing the wedding's nature, but they chose to do so based on their personal beliefs about the couple's relationship.\n\n@MeditativeMonk81, your perspective is appreciated.
