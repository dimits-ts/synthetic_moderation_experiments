Love is love.\n  - Me: Oh, here we go again with the 'love is love' bs. Newsflash, @User123, not everything that's 'love' is normal or healthy. Some people just need to accept that their feelings are abnormal and seek help.\n\n* @User456 responding You're just a homophobic bigot, @SarcasticTechBro92.\n  - Me: And you're just another sheep following the 'woke' narrative, @User456. I'm not homophobic, I'm just stating facts. You can't argue with biology.\n\n* @Moderator warning Please keep the conversation respectful and civil, or you'll be removed.\n  - Me: Oh, I'm sorry, @Moderator. I didn't realize facts were no longer allowed in this forum. I'll try to keep my 'alternative' opinions to myself.",
