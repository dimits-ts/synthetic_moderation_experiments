The Awan brothers' case was a single instance of misconduct, not a sign of widespread liberal bias. The Clinton email scandal was investigated thoroughly, and no charges were brought against her. As for the Obama administration's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, it was a matter of diplomatic engagement, not cozying up. And the bloated, unionized bureaucracy you speak of is a result of decades of bipartisan policy, not just liberal ones.\n\nNow, I'm not saying there isn't bias or incompetence in our government. That's a given in any large, complex organization.
