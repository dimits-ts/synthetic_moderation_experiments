And let me tell you, @DoomerPhilosopher21, while correlation might not imply causation, ignoring the fact that men are statistically more involved in these issues is like ignoring the elephant in the room. We need to address the reality, not hide behind philosophical semantics.\n\nAnd @FitnessJunkie07, I appreciate your passion, but let's not forget that generalization can be just as harmful as ignorance.
