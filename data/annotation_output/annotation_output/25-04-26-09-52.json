It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about challenging the harmful behaviors that are too often excused or ignored because they're committed by men.\n\n@moderator, I understand the need for respectful dialogue, but let's not shy away from the uncomfortable truths. The fact is, men have historically held positions of power and privilege, and with that comes a responsibility to examine and challenge our own behaviors. It's not about demonizing men, it's about holding them accountable.\n\nAs for what constitutes healthy and normal sexual behavior, I'd argue it's anything that's consensual, respectful, and considerate of all parties involved. It's about communication, mutual pleasure, and understanding that no means no, and only yes means yes.

Toxic masculinity is a product of a society that expects men to be dominant, aggressive, and unemotional.
