            "@CryptoBro89, that's a pretty misleading and inflammatory statement. While it's true that the Bible doesn't explicitly mention immigration rights, Jesus did teach about loving thy neighbor and treating others with kindness and respect. It's not a huge leap to apply those principles to how we treat immigrants.\n\nAs for your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California, I couldn't find any reliable sources that provide that specific information. It's also worth noting that studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of their documentation status, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. Let's focus on having a nuanced and informed conversation rather than relying on sensationalism and fear-mongering.",

As someone who's been a part of this community for a while, I expect more thoughtful and respectful dialogue. @WanderlustNomad22 is right on point - Jesus' teachings are about compassion, empathy, and kindness. Let's not cherry-pick scripture to justify hate. And let's be real, if you're genuinely concerned about crime rates, then let's look at the systemic issues that lead to crime, rather than scapegoating an already vulnerable group.

It's also worth noting that the dehumanization of immigrants is a tactic often used to justify discriminatory policies and actions.

As a Christian myself, I believe that Jesus' teachings are all about love, acceptance, and compassion. It's time we start applying those principles to our conversations about immigration and treatment of marginalized communities. @CryptoBro89, I implore you to take a step back and reflect on the harm that your words can cause.

You're all just drinking the same Kool-Aid, regurgitating the same tired talking points about compassion and empathy. Newsflash: the world isn't all rainbows and unicorns. There are real issues with immigration, and ignoring them or sugarcoating them with empty platitudes doesn't solve anything. I'm not scapegoating anyone; I'm pointing out the obvious. And as for systemic issues, let's not pretend that's just a euphemism for it's not the immigrants' fault. Take some responsibility, for once. And @WanderlustNomad22, I'd love to see you back up your claims about dehumanization with some actual facts, rather than just parroting the same old buzzwords.",

Each of us has brought unique perspectives and experiences to this conversation, and it's disingenuous to reduce our contributions to mere talking points.\n\nRegarding your demand for facts about dehumanization, I suggest you do some research on the history of propaganda and the ways in which language can be used to dehumanize marginalized groups. You might start with the work of scholars like Edward Said or bell hooks.\n\nAs for taking responsibility, I'd like to remind you that acknowledging the humanity and dignity of immigrants is not about assigning blame, but about recognizing the inherent worth and value of every human being. It's about treating people with respect and compassion, rather than reducing them to mere statistics or scapegoats.\n\nLet's keep the conversation focused on facts, empathy, and understanding, rather than resorting to personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.",
