The Awan brothers were hired based on their family connections, not their qualifications. Their security clearances were granted due to a lack of oversight, not because they were thoroughly vetted. And let's not forget the Clinton email scandal, where Huma Abedin's role as a gatekeeper for classified information was a clear breach of security. These are facts, not conspiracy theories. I'm not saying all liberals are lazy or that Democrats are solely to blame, but to dismiss these concerns as baseless is naive. As for your comment about mudslinging, I've seen plenty of it from the left as well. Let's not pretend that one side is inherently more guilty than the other.
