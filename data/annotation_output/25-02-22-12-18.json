Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for\na gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race\nwedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding.

If a baker refuses to make a cake for a gay wedding, they're not just refusing service, they're making a statement about who deserves to be celebrated. It's not the same as refusing service based on race or religion, which are protected classes. Being LGBTQ+ isn't. Plus, your Catholic jab is a bit off.
