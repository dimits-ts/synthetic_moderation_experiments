      "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agendaâ€™s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

      "@LiberalLizzy, I'm not sure where you're getting your statistics from, but it's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because Hillary Clinton's campaign chair had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood doesn't mean she intentionally gave him a security clearance. And the Awan brothers were hired by Democrats and Republicans alike, so it's not a partisan issue. As for your generalization about government employees, that's a bit reductive. Many public servants are dedicated and hardworking, regardless of their political affiliation. And while I agree that unions can sometimes be a hindrance, dismantling them entirely seems like an overreaction.",

      "Thank you, @QuietThinker92, for bringing up the point about correlation vs causation. It's a crucial distinction to make in discussions like these.\n\n@LiberalLizzy, could you please share the sources for your statistics? It's important to keep our discussion grounded in facts and accurate information.\n\nAlso, let's remember to keep our conversation respectful and focused on the issues at hand. Personal attacks or derogatory language will not be tolerated. Let's strive to understand different perspectives and learn from one another.",

      "@QuietThinker92, I appreciate your measured response and the moderator's reminder to keep our discussion civil. However, I must say, @LiberalLizzy's comments, while perhaps misinformed, are not entirely unfounded. The Awan brothers' case is still under investigation, and there are legitimate concerns about their potential ties to foreign governments. As for Hillary Clinton's decision to give Huma Abedin a security clearance, it's true that Abedin's family has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and while correlation doesn't imply causation, it's also not a stretch to question the judgment of someone who would ignore such glaring red flags.\n\n@LiberalLizzy, I understand that you're passionate about your beliefs, but it's crucial to back up your claims with evidence. The statistics you've provided are alarming, but without sources, they're just speculation. I'd be happy to engage in a productive discussion if you can provide some credible sources.\n\nAs for your generalization about government employees, I must disagree. I've worked in public service for over two decades, and I've seen firsthand that most people are dedicated, hardworking, and committed to doing their jobs well. It's easy to point fingers and blame, but that doesn't solve anything. We should be focusing on improving our systems, not demonizing our public servants.\n\nNow, @QuietThinker92, I'd like to hear your thoughts on how we can improve our vetting processes to prevent such issues in the future. I believe we can agree that better oversight and stricter standards are needed, regardless of political affiliation.",

      "@OptimisticTeacher59, I appreciate your calm and rational approach, but I must disagree with your defense of @LiberalLizzy's unfounded claims. Her statistics are not just alarming, they're baseless and serve only to spread fear and misinformation. I've been in this community for years, and I've seen firsthand how such unfounded accusations can divide us and distract from real issues.\n\n@LiberalLizzy, you've been asked repeatedly for sources, yet you've provided none. This isn't a game, and we're not here to spread conspiracy theories. If you can't back up your claims, then you're just adding noise to an important discussion. If you're serious about this, provide evidence, or step aside and let those who can contribute meaningfully take the lead.\n\nAs for improving vetting processes, @QuietThinker92, I agree that stricter standards are needed. However, I believe we should also focus on improving our understanding of potential threats. We need better intelligence gathering, not just more stringent checks. We should be looking at patterns of behavior, not just associations. And we should be investing in technology to help us identify potential risks more effectively.\n\nBut let's not forget, the real issue here is not just about vetting, but about the culture of impunity that allows bad actors to thrive. We need to hold our leaders accountable, regardless of political affiliation. That's the only way we can ensure that our systems are truly secure.",

As for @LiberalLizzy's statistics, I've seen her share them in other threads, but I'll wait for her to provide them here as well. As a travel blogger, I've seen firsthand how misinformation can spread quickly, so I understand your concern. But let's not dismiss her claims outright without giving her a chance to defend them.\n\nAs for improving vetting processes, I think we need to consider the human element more. We can have all the technology and intelligence gathering in the world, but if we don't have people who are trained to recognize red flags and make informed decisions, it's all for nothing. We need to invest in training our vetting teams, not just in technology.\n\nAnd @QuietThinker92, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
