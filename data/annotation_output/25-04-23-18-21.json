Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

By refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding, the baker is effectively saying I don't support your lifestyle. It's not about asking about sexuality, it's about the implications of their actions. And let's not forget, this isn't about a single cake, it's about a pattern of discrimination. As for your point about offering artwork to the public, that's a different scenario. A cake is a custom product, often made to order, and the baker has more control over who they serve. Plus, the case you're referring to involved racial discrimination, which is explicitly illegal. This is about sexual orientation, which, while protected in many places, is still a contentious issue in many legal systems. Lastly, I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to have a nuanced conversation about complex issues. Let's keep it civil, yeah?",

While it's true that the transaction is between the baker and the customer, the act of refusing service based on the nature of the event (in this case, a gay wedding) sends a clear message of disapproval and discrimination. It's not about asking about one's sexuality, but about the implications of one's actions.\n\nAs for your point about offering artwork to the public, @OptimisticTeacher59, while it's true that cakes are often custom-made, the principle of non-discrimination still applies. We must remember that we're discussing human rights here, and the right to equal service is a fundamental one. The fact that racial discrimination is explicitly illegal does not make it any less wrong, and the same logic applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nI must admit, @OptimisticTeacher59, your response seemed a bit aggressive, and I understand why WanderlustNomad22 might have felt that way.
