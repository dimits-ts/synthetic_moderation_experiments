      "@RealPatriot123, I'm not here to argue about religious texts, but to discuss facts. The Bible might not explicitly mention immigration rights, but it does talk about treating strangers with kindness and compassion (Leviticus 19:33-34). Now, let's focus on your question. According to the California Attorney General's office, in 2020, undocumented immigrants made up 3.5% of California's population but were responsible for 2.6% of homicides. That's a significant difference from your implied suggestion. Let's keep the conversation civil and fact-based, shall we?",

Newsflash, buddy, the world doesn't owe you anything. It's dog-eat-dog out there, and if you can't see that, you're part of the problem.\n\nAnd @CitySlicker05, don't give me that we're all here to learn and grow nonsense. I'm here because I pay my taxes, and I'll say what I damn well please. You want constructive? How about we start talking about the real issues, like why our government is hell-bent on ruining this country with their socialist agenda?\n\nAnd another thing, @RealPatriot123, where the hell are you?

It's not about expecting something from the world, but about treating others as we'd like to be treated ourselves. Now, I ain't saying we should ignore facts or common sense, but having a heart and understanding others' struggles don't make us weak or liberal. As for your government conspiracies, I'm all ears if you've got some solid evidence, but until then, let's not spread unfounded fears.
