I'm a woman, and I've had my fair share of dealing with men who've made me uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean all men are predators. We need to hold individuals accountable, not entire genders.\n\n@CynicalInvestor88, I appreciate your nuanced response. It's important to acknowledge that while not all men are predators, many men do benefit from systemic issues that allow them to get away with harmful behavior.
