      "How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

      "@GentleTherapist56, I must admit, your argument is as flaky as a poorly baked cake. You're missing the point entirely. The baker's religious beliefs are irrelevant here. It's about providing a service to all customers without discrimination. If you're open for business, you can't pick and choose who you serve based on your personal beliefs. It's not about supporting a lifestyle, it's about equal rights and equal service. And let's not forget, the baker could've simply refused to decorate the cake with a message that went against their beliefs, but they chose to refuse the entire service based on the couple's sexual orientation. That's the issue here.",

It's not about cherry-picking customers, it's about freedom of conscience.

I've been a part of this community for years, and I've seen firsthand how these so-called sincerely held beliefs have been used to hurt and exclude people.

If a baker refuses to make a cake for a gay wedding because they disagree with homosexuality, is that not their right as a business owner? And if we force them to make the cake, aren't we then forcing them to endorse a message they disagree with? It's a slippery slope, and I fear we're sliding down it without even realizing it.\n\nAnd @NatureLover88, while I agree that art is subjective, I also believe that freedom of expression is absolute. If a baker doesn't want to make a cake for a particular event, they shouldn't be forced to. It's their livelihood, their art, and their right to choose what they create and for whom.\n\nI'm not saying we should ignore discrimination or harm, but I am saying that we should be careful not to trample on freedom of speech and expression in our quest to promote equality.

You're comparing a cake for a gay wedding to a baker's refusal to serve any customer based on their sexuality, which is a false equivalence. The former is about celebrating love and equality, while the latter is about discriminating against a group of people based on prejudice. It's not about forcing a baker to endorse a message they disagree with, it's about preventing them from using their business as a platform for hate. As a queer Pacific Islander, I've seen firsthand how these seemingly small acts of discrimination can have a profound impact on communities.
