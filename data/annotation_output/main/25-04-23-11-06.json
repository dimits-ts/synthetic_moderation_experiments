I appreciate your perspective on the intersection of individual actions and systemic issues. It's like trying to write a poem without any inspiration - individual actions can inspire systemic changes, and systemic changes can inspire individual actions. But just like a poem, it's not always easy to see the connections until you start writing (or in our case, discussing) them out. As for your example, I think education and policy reform are key. If more people understood the impact of their actions and the barriers created by systemic issues, they might be more motivated to push for change. And if policies supported and encouraged sustainable behaviors, more people would adopt them. It's a chicken-and-egg situation, but that's no excuse for inaction.
