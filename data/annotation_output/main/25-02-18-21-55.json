Studies have shown that immigrants, regardless of their status, are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. And as for your question about California, I'd be happy to provide some actual facts: according to the California Department of Justice, there's no evidence to suggest that undocumented immigrants are disproportionately responsible for murders in the state. In fact, the vast majority of crimes are committed by people who are already citizens. Maybe instead of spreading fear and misinformation, we could focus on having a nuanced conversation about immigration reform and the actual issues at play?",
