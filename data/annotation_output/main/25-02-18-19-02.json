And let me tell you, dismantling systems isn't just about grand gestures, it's about the everyday choices we make. For me, it starts with calling out toxic behavior when I see it, even if it's uncomfortable. It means having tough conversations with friends and family members who may not want to listen. And yeah, it's hard, but that's what needs to happen.\n\nAs for concrete steps, I think we need to start by educating ourselves and others about the harm caused by toxic masculinity. We need to listen to and amplify the voices of those who are most affected by it, like women, non-binary folks, and people of color. We need to create spaces where people can share their experiences and feel heard. And we need to hold ourselves and others accountable for our actions.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your clarification question, but I want to push back on the idea that we need to balance tough conversations with respectful tones.
