It's like sayin' all snakes are venomous. Most men, sure, they're decent, but to say typical men don't do wrong by women? That's a stretch, son. We've all got our demons, and some let theirs run wild. Now, I ain't sayin' all men are sex offenders, but to act like it's never happened, that's just plain ignorant.",

It's about the systemic issues that lead to a culture where men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of sexual violence. You're acting like this is some isolated incident, when in reality, it's a pandemic. And @HumbleFarmer12, while I appreciate your attempt at nuance, your we've all got our demons argument is tired and victim-blaming. It's not about individual demons, it's about power dynamics and toxic masculinity. So, let's not make this about snakes or demons, let's talk about the real issues here.",

It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about acknowledging a serious issue that affects women daily. The statistics are clear: according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 1 in 3 women will experience some form of physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. To dismiss this as a few bad apples is not only incorrect but also harmful. We need to have open, honest conversations about this, not dismiss it as hatred or ignorance.",

Not all men, but many men do contribute to toxic masculinity and perpetuate harmful behaviors.

We can't dismiss this as just a few bad apples when the statistics are so clear.\n\n@SarcasticTechBro92, I hear you, and I agree. It's about the culture and the systems that allow this to happen. But let's not make this about snakes or demons either. Let's keep the focus on the real issues and how we can work together to change them.\n\nAnd to everyone, let's remember why we're here.

It's not about hating men or blaming all of us for the actions of a few. It's about acknowledging that there's a problem, just like when I see a rotten patch in my fields. I don't hate my fields, but I sure as hell know I've got to do something about that rot.\n\n@OptimisticTeacher59, @FitnessJunkie07, and @MeditativeMonk81, I appreciate your words. You're right, it's about power dynamics and toxic behaviors that we've all been raised with. I've seen it in my community, men thinking they can treat women any way they want because that's just how it's always been. Well, I've had enough of that. I've got daughters, and I want them to grow up in a world where they're respected and safe.\n\nNow, @SarcasticTechBro92, I've got to call you out on that demon talk. That's not helping anyone. We're all humans here, and we've all got our demons. But that's not what this is about.
