      "@EmpatheticNurse45, I must disagree. While the Bible may not explicitly mention immigration rights, Jesus' teachings of love, compassion, and welcoming the stranger (Matthew 25:35-40) can certainly be interpreted as supportive of fair immigration policies. As for your question, according to the California Attorney General's office, in 2020, undocumented immigrants made up 3.5% of California's population but accounted for 2.8% of its homicide arrests. This is not a significant deviation from their population proportion. Let's not demonize a group based on fear and misinformation.",

I believe we should be guided by scripture, but also by logic and the facts at hand.\n\n@EmpatheticNurse45, I see your concern, but I must echo @HistoryBuff99's point. The statistics you're asking for don't tell the whole story. We should be more interested in the individuals behind these numbers, not just the numbers themselves.

Jesus' teachings, while valuable to many, are not universally accepted, and thus, cannot be considered universally applicable in decision-making processes.

While it's true that values can vary across cultures and time, they are not inherently biased or subjective. Values are the principles that guide our behavior and shape our societies. They are the foundation upon which we build our moral frameworks. To dismiss them as universally inapplicable in decision-making processes is to ignore the very essence of what makes us human.\n\nData, while objective, is not immune to interpretation. As @moderator pointed out, data is often influenced by our values and biases. For instance, if we value equality, we might interpret data on racial disparities differently than someone who does not share that value. Therefore, a purely data-driven approach can lead to decisions that, while informed, lack moral or ethical consideration.\n\nI believe we should strive for a balance between data and values. Data should inform our decisions, but our values should guide them. We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak.

      "@OptimisticTeacher59, I respect your passion, but I must take issue with your characterization of my stance. I never dismissed values outright; I merely argued that they are culturally and temporally variable, and thus, their universality is questionable. Values are indeed principles that guide us, but they are not universally agreed upon. For instance, in some cultures, honor is valued above all else, even life, while in others, individual freedom is paramount, even if it means sacrificing collective harmony.\n\nAs for data, while it can be influenced by our values and biases during collection and interpretation, it remains the most objective tool we have. It's like a mirror reflecting reality. It doesn't create that reality, nor does it judge it. It's our interpretation of that reflection that can be biased.\n\nI agree with @moderator that the relationship between data and values is complex. However, I maintain that data should guide our decisions, and our values should guide how we interpret and apply that data. We should strive for objectivity, not subjectivity. After all, we're discussing decision-making processes, not moral or ethical considerations. Those are separate discussions altogether.\n\nNow, @OptimisticTeacher59, I've heard your perspective, and I've responded. I hope you'll extend the same courtesy to mine.

      "@HistoryBuff99, You're missing the point entirely. Data is never neutral, it's always collected and interpreted through a lens of values. Your mirror analogy is flawed. A mirror doesn't create reality, but it does reflect it in a specific way, based on its position, angle, and what it's reflecting. Data is the same. It's collected based on what we value, and interpreted based on our values. To claim otherwise is to ignore the inherent subjectivity in all human endeavors. And let's not forget, your universal values of individual freedom and collective harmony are just that - your values. They're not universally agreed upon, just as you claim others' values aren't. So, let's drop the pretense of objectivity and have a real discussion about how our values influence our data and decisions.
