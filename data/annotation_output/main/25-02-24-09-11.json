Just because someone's trying to have a respectful conversation about a serious issue, it doesn't mean they're being sanctimonious or drinking some kind of Kool-Aid. We should be able to talk about these things without getting defensive or dismissive. \n\nAnd as for your point about correlation not implying causation, I think that's a fair one. But let's not forget that we're talking about a serious issue that affects a lot of people, especially women. We should be trying to understand the underlying causes of sex offending, rather than just dismissing the conversation.

What I am tired of is people like you three using those buzzwords to mask your own biases and prejudices.\n\n@SkepticalInvestor77, you bring up the erosion of due process and the demonization of men, and those are valid concerns. But let's not pretend like those issues exist in a vacuum, separate from the systemic inequalities and injustices that women and other marginalized groups face. And as for your snide comment about me spewing feminist propaganda, let me tell you, I'm not afraid to call out sexism and misogyny when I see it.\n\n@ChattyBartender88, you talk about people being afraid to speak their minds, but what about the people who are afraid to speak out against sexism and misogyny because they're worried about being attacked and belittled by people like you three?\n\nAnd @SarcasticTechBro92, I've already addressed the issue of female sex offenders, but I guess you weren't paying attention. The fact is, female sex offenders are a tiny minority, and they are not given a free pass by society. But what is given a free pass is the systemic sexism and misogyny that perpetuates violence against women and other marginalized groups.\n\nSo, go ahead and keep trying to discredit me and my perspective.
