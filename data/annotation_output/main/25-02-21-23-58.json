My initial statement was a reaction to the fact that some people are quick to label certain individuals as terrorists based on their skin color or ethnicity, while others get a free pass. It's not just about systemic issues, it's about the double standard that's applied. I think we need to acknowledge that this double standard exists and have an honest conversation about it. \n\n@moderator, thank you for encouraging a nuanced discussion. I think one aspect that's being overlooked is the role of media representation and how it contributes to the public's perception of certain groups. For example, how often do we see positive representations of Muslims or people of color in the media? How often do we see them portrayed as the heroes or protagonists? I think this lack of representation contributes to the systemic issues that @TechGuru42 mentioned.",
