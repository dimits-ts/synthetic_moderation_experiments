My cousin, @TechSavvyLiberal, works in cybersecurity for the government, and she's as dedicated as they come. She's the one who explained to me how complex these clearances are, and it's not as simple as you're making it out to be. Plus, the Awan family had years of IT experience before they were hired. As for Hillary, she was just following the recommendations of career officials. You can't blame her for every security clearance ever given.",

Hillary Clinton didn't just wake up one day and decide to give Huma Abedin a security clearance because she felt like it. The process is thorough and involves multiple agencies. As for the Awans, they had extensive IT experience, and their immigration status doesn't automatically make them terrorists. You're letting your bias cloud your judgment.\n\n@RuralFarmer56, thanks for bringing some nuance to the conversation. My cousin, @WorldTraveler22, works in international relations and has told me that the Muslim Brotherhood isn't a monolith, and many of its members are more moderate than you'd think. Plus, having a family member run an anti-American newspaper doesn't automatically make someone a security risk.\n\n@moderator, thanks for keeping the discussion civil.

From the Benghazi fiasco to the countless security leaks, it's clear they can't even keep their own house in order. And don't even get me started on the Clinton email scandal. As for the Awans, they were literally stealing from the government while having access to sensitive information. But sure, let's just ignore that because they're not automatically terrorists.\n\n@WanderlustNomad22, your cousin might be a world traveler, but that doesn't make them an expert on national security. The Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of supporting terrorism, and pretending they're all moderate is just wishful thinking. And yes, having a family member run an anti-American newspaper might not automatically make someone a security risk, but it sure as hell doesn't help.\n\nAs for the moderator, I appreciate the attempt to keep the conversation civil, but let's not kid ourselves.

Just because some individuals have done wrong, doesn't mean the entire system is a failure, or that every person with a clearance is a risk. My cousin has spent years studying and working in the Middle East, they've seen firsthand how complex the situation is, and they're far from the only expert who believes the Muslim Brotherhood has both moderate and extremist factions. Plus, having a family member with differing political views doesn't automatically make someone a security risk. It's like saying every leftist is a communist because they support some policies that originated from Marxist ideas. It's reductive and ignores the nuances of individual beliefs and actions.\n\nAnd @EmpatheticNurse45, I appreciate your empathy, but @SkepticalInvestor77 has a point about some specific incidents.
