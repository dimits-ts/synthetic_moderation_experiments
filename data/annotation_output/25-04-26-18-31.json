But you're too busy playing the blame game to see that.\n\nNow, I'm not saying either of you is wrong, but you're both missing the bigger picture. It's like you're both looking at a puzzle but only focusing on your own piece. You need to step back and see how they all fit together.\n\nAnd @GentleTherapist56, while I appreciate your attempt at keeping the peace, let's not sugarcoat it.

            "@SkepticalInvestor77, I appreciate your perspective, but I have to disagree with your dismissive tone towards @RebelCoder07 and myself. You're right, we're here to discuss and learn, but that doesn't mean we should throw respect out the window. I'm not suggesting we hold hands and sing kumbaya, but a little empathy goes a long way. You seem to be dismissing our feelings as touchy-feely when we're simply asking for our experiences and viewpoints to be validated. It's not about being sensitive, it's about being human. And while I agree that systemic issues are real, dismissing individual experiences only perpetuates the problem. Let's strive for a balance, shall we?",
