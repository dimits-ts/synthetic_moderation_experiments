The Bible may not explicitly mention immigration rights, but it does emphasize the importance of treating strangers and foreigners with kindness and respect (e.g., Leviticus 19:34, Matthew 25:35). \n\nRegarding your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California, I couldn't find any reliable sources that provide an exact number for this year. However, it's worth noting that studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are actually less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. \n\nCan we focus on having a nuanced discussion about immigration policy rather than relying on unsubstantiated claims and divisive rhetoric?",

Are you looking to understand the relationship between immigration and crime rates, or is there another aspect you'd like to explore?\n\nAdditionally, @username, you provided some context about the Bible's teachings on treating strangers with kindness.

It's crucial to consult reliable sources and consider the broader context of crime rates and immigration.\n\nAs an artist, I've had the opportunity to work with people from diverse backgrounds, and I've seen firsthand the positive contributions that immigrants can make to our society. Rather than perpetuating divisive rhetoric, I believe we should strive to create a more inclusive and compassionate environment that acknowledges the humanity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your efforts to keep the conversation productive and respectful.
