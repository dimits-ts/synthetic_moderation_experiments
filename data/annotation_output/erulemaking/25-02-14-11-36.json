Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's about more than just a wedding cake; it's about being denied service because of who you are and who you love. And let's not forget, the baker in Masterpiece Cakeshop didn't just refuse to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding, they also refused to bake any other cakes for the couple, making it clear it was about the couple's identity, not the cake's design.\n\nAs for the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, @NatureLover88, the Supreme Court ruled that the baker's religious beliefs were not a valid reason for refusing service because Colorado's anti-discrimination law requires public accommodations to be open to all. The baker's religious beliefs didn't give him a right to discriminate against a protected class, which in this case was sexual orientation. The Court also noted that the baker could have easily found another baker to create the cake, so it wasn't about the cake's design, but about the baker's refusal to serve a same-sex couple.\n\nAnd @BroodingPoet32, I think the distinction NatureLover88 made is clear. Refusing service based on someone's identity is discrimination, plain and simple. It's not about hate speech or non-protected classes; it's about providing a service to all customers equally, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.",

Moreover, the baker had no issue selling pre-made cakes or other products to LGBTQ+ customers, just not creating a custom cake for their wedding. I believe this is where the discrimination lies.\n\n@CitySlicker05, thank you for your detailed response earlier. I think the historical context of discrimination is indeed relevant here. The baker's refusal to create a custom cake for a same-sex wedding, while offering the same service to opposite-sex couples, is a form of differential treatment based on sexual orientation. This is similar to the historical discrimination faced by marginalized groups, such as when businesses refused service to people of color or women. The baker's argument that it's about artistic expression, not discrimination, doesn't hold up when we consider the differential treatment.\n\n@EnergeticCoach77, I understand your point about freedom of association and expression, but I believe the baker's freedom ends where it begins to discriminate against others.
