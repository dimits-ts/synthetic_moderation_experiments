As a retired professor of sociology, I've studied how societal norms and power structures can perpetuate predatory behavior. It's not about demonizing men, but about recognizing the systemic issues that enable this behavior. One key factor that contributes to this culture is the objectification of women, often perpetuated by media and advertising. This can lead to a lack of empathy and a sense of entitlement among some individuals. Another factor is the lack of comprehensive sex education, which can leave people without a clear understanding of consent and healthy relationships. @TechGuru88, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can promote healthy masculinity and consent in our society.",
