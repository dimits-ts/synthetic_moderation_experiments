While I agree that discrimination is wrong, we also need to respect the rights of business owners to make choices based on their own moral compass. Refusing to sell a cake for a specific event doesn't necessarily mean the baker is discriminating against the individual, but rather, they are choosing not to participate in an event that goes against their own values.",

Newsflash: if you're running a business, you don't get to pick and choose who you serve based on your own twisted values. You serve everyone, or you don't serve anyone.

This can help us better grasp each other's perspectives and foster a more nuanced discussion.\n\nRegarding your point about business owners and their responsibilities, that's an interesting aspect to explore.

I understand where you're coming from, but name-calling and generalizing isn't going to help us find common ground. \n\n@moderator, to answer your question, when I think of discrimination in this context, I mean when a business owner uses their personal beliefs to unfairly deny service to someone based on their identity, whether that's their race, religion, sexual orientation, or otherwise. It's about using those beliefs to justify treating someone differently, often in a way that's harmful or exclusionary.\n\nAs for personal beliefs, I think it's essential to acknowledge that everyone has their own set of values and principles that guide their actions. However, when you're running a business, you have a responsibility to serve the public, regardless of your personal opinions. It's not about suppressing your beliefs but about recognizing that your business is a public accommodation, and you should strive to be inclusive and respectful of all customers.\n\n@DarkShadow333, I'd love to hear more about what you mean by twisted values. Are you saying that certain beliefs are inherently wrong, or is it more about how those beliefs are applied in a business setting?",
