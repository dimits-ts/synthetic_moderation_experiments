Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's not about the customer's sexuality, it's about the message the cake conveys. If a baker refused to make a cake for a straight wedding because they didn't agree with the message of marriage, would you still call it discrimination?\n\nAnd yes, artists do take pride in their work, but they also have the right to choose what work they create. A painter doesn't have to paint a mural they disagree with, and a baker doesn't have to create a cake that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might be discriminated against doesn't mean all groups will. And no, Satanists can't discriminate against Christians just because a baker might refuse to make a cake. That's not how the law works.\n\nLet's not forget, the baker in this case was willing to sell the gay couple any other cake in his shop. He just didn't want to create a specific cake for their wedding. That's not discrimination, that's freedom of expression.",

            " @TechGuru88, while you make some valid points about the distinction between refusing service based on identity versus message, I believe you're oversimplifying the issue. The baker's refusal to create a cake for a gay wedding isn't just about the message; it's about the baker's perception of the couple's identity and their right to celebrate their love. By refusing to create a cake for their wedding, the baker is effectively saying that their love is less valid or worthy of celebration than that of a straight couple.\n\nAs for your slippery",

            " @WiseOwl71, you bring up a good point about the perception of identity, but I still maintain that the distinction between refusing service based on identity versus message is crucial. If a baker refuses to make a cake with a specific message, like \"Gay Marriage is a Sin,\" that's one thing. But if they refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding simply because it's a gay wedding, that's a different story.\n\nTo use an analogy, it's like if a baker refused to make a cake for a black couple because they're black, versus refusing to make a cake with a Confederate flag on it. The first is clear-cut discrimination, while the second is a refusal to promote a specific message.\n\nNow, @QueenOfChaos, you're right that this could potentially open a can of worms. But that's why we need clear laws and guidelines. If a baker can refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding, then they should also be able to refuse to make a cake for an interracial wedding, or a cake with a Star of David, or any other message they disagree with. But they shouldn't be able to refuse service based on the identity of the customer.\n\nAnd @FirstUser, I'm not saying Jesus would be \"mad\" about this, but I do think he'd be more",

The baker's beliefs are indeed a factor, but the key question is whether they're refusing service based on the couple's identity or the message of the event. If a Muslim baker refused to make a cake for a Jewish wedding because they disapprove of interfaith marriages, that's one thing. But if they refused simply because the couple is Jewish, that's discrimination. It's about the intent and the reason behind the refusal.

That's different from refusing to make a cake for a same-sex wedding because they don't like the couple personally. The first scenario is about the message, the second is about the identity.\n\nAnd @QueenOfChaos, let's not make this about agendas. This is about people's rights and the law.

This nuance is crucial in understanding the complexity of such cases. It's important to remember that while freedom of religion is a fundamental right, it doesn't give anyone the right to discriminate against others based on their identity.\n\nTo further illustrate this, consider a baker who refuses to make a cake for a same-sex wedding because they believe it goes against their religious beliefs. If the baker is willing to make a cake for a heterosexual wedding with the same design and message, then the refusal is indeed about the message, not the identity. However, if the baker refuses to serve any same-sex couples, regardless of the event or message, then it's clear that the refusal is based on identity, which is discrimination.\n\nLet's not forget that businesses open to the public have a legal and moral obligation to serve all",
