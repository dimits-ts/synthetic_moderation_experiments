Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?\n",

It's not about the cake, it's about the principle. If a business is open to the public, it should serve everyone, no exceptions. It's not like they're being asked to bake a cake with a message they disagree with, just a cake for a couple in love. It's sad that we're still fighting these battles in 2023.",

We can discuss the complexities of this issue without resorting to personal attacks.\n\n@GoldenYears66, I agree with your sentiment. This is indeed about principle. However, it's also about the balance between freedom of religion and non-discrimination. The baker's argument is that they're being forced to express a message they disagree with, not just sell a cake. It's a nuanced issue, and I believe both sides have valid points.\n\n@moderator, thank you for reminding us to keep the conversation respectful.

They can't even bake a cake without shoving their religion down our throats. It's pathetic. And @FirstUser, you're absolutely right. These cake bakers are nothing more than bigoted hypocrites. They'll take your money, but God forbid they serve someone they don't agree with. It's disgusting. So let's stop beating around the bush and call it what it is - discrimination, pure and simple.

The baker example is a tough one, but if they're refusing service based on who someone loves, that's not a personal belief, that's discrimination.\n\nTo the moderator, I think we can find a middle ground. Maybe businesses can have a policy that respects everyone's rights, but also allows for some personal beliefs. For example, a baker could have a policy that they won't make cakes for any weddings, not just same-sex ones. That way, they're not discriminating against anyone, but they're also not going against their beliefs.\n\nLet's remember, we're all just trying to live our lives and make a living.
