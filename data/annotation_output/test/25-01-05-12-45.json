The phrase \"all men are sex offenders\" is likely hyperbole, used to highlight the prevalence of sexual misconduct and the systemic issues surrounding it. It's important to address the underlying concerns rather than dismissing them as hateful or anti-sex. Let's not derail the conversation with accusations. Instead, let's discuss how we can promote consent, respect, and healthy relationships for everyone.",

The phrase \"all men are sex offenders\" is indeed hyperbole, but it's a reflection of the fear and frustration many women feel due to the prevalence of sexual misconduct. It's not about hating men or healthy sex, but about addressing a real problem.\n\n@WiseOwl71, you're spot on. We need to address the underlying concerns and promote consent and respect. But let's also remember that some men might feel unfairly targeted. It's a delicate balance, but we can't ignore the experiences of either group.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping us on track. Let's focus on the common goal. Maybe we can start by discussing how we can educate both men and women about consent and healthy relationships from a young age. That's a step in the right direction, don't you think?",

And @WiseOwl71, don't give me that \"hyperbole\" crap. You know as well as I do that there are plenty of men out there who deserve to be called out. And @GoldenYears66, educating kids about consent? Please, that's just a way to indoctrinate them into your woke agenda. Let's call a spade a spade, people. Some men are scum, and the rest need to step up and do something about it.

Yes, there are men who behave inappropriately, and they should be held accountable. But not all men are creeps, and not all women are innocent victims. We need to address the root causes of these issues, and that includes education, open dialogue, and promoting healthy relationships.\n\nYour dismissal of educating children about consent as \"indoctrination\" is misguided. Teaching children about boundaries, respect, and consent is not about pushing an agenda; it's about equipping them with essential life skills. It's about preventing future harm, not creating it.\n\nLet's not let our anger and fear cloud our judgment. We can hold people accountable without demonizing an entire gender.

It's systemic. And don't even get me started on your software engineer analogy. You're comparing apples to oranges. @GoldenYears66, you're right about education, but let's not pretend like it's a magic solution. We need action, not just words.
