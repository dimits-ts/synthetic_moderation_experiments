Sometimes, it just makes the other person defensive and less likely to listen. We all have different perspectives and experiences that shape our views, and dismissing someone's feelings as \"snowflake\" behavior doesn't help us understand those views better.\n\nAs @doing_my_best24 and @moderator have pointed out, we can have passionate discussions without belittling others.

To answer your question, @doing_my_best24, I remember a time when I was teaching a class on controversial topics. One student was very passionate about their views, and initially, the discussion was quite heated. However, by actively listening and showing empathy, I was able to understand their perspective better. This led to a more productive conversation where both sides learned from each other.

            " @QueenOfChaos, I appreciate your candor, but I must disagree with your dismissal of empathy and understanding. In my experience, people who are quick to dismiss others' feelings often do so because they're afraid of confronting their own. It's easier to label others as \"sensitive\" than to engage in a meaningful dialogue.\n\nIn the real world, as you put it, people often don't have the time or patience for understanding because they're too busy trying to prove they're right. But that's precisely why we need to make the effort. It's not about being \"right\" or \"wrong,\" but about learning and growing together.\n\nAs for your analogy, the kitchen is a place where different ingredients come together to create something new and delicious. It's not about who can handle the heat, but about how we can work together to create something better.\n\nLet's not let our frustration with the world turn us into the very thing we dislike. Let's strive for understanding, even when it's difficult. That's how we move forward. \ud83c\udf31",

But dismissing empathy and understanding as \"feel-good BS\" is a bit shortsighted. In software engineering, for instance, we often have to work with diverse teams and clients. If we just throw everyone into the pot and turn up the heat, we'd end up with a buggy, inefficient mess. But if we take the time to understand each other's perspectives and work together, we can create something truly innovative. It's not about being soft, it's about being smart.

            " @QueenOfChaos, I understand your perspective, but I must disagree with your approach. The kitchen analogy you used is indeed flawed. In a real kitchen, a good chef knows that each ingredient has its unique properties and needs to be treated accordingly. They don't just throw everything in the pot and hope for the best. They understand, respect, and work with each ingredient to create a harmonious dish.\n\nIn the same way, in any group or community, each person brings their unique experiences, perspectives, and skills to the table. Dismissing others' viewpoints as \"feel-good BS\" is not only disrespectful but also counterproductive. It's like throwing away ingredients because you don't understand their value.\n\nAs for your claim that people don't have time for \"touchy-feely stuff,\" I'd argue that understanding and empathy are not luxuries we can afford to ignore. They are the foundation of effective communication and collaboration. Without them, we're left with a group of individuals who may be efficient but are not",
