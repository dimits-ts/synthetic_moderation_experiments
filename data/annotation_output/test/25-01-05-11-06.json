Or the ones who think \"no means yes\"? You're right, not all men are sex offenders, but enough of them are to make every woman wary. And don't even get me started on the \"healthy, normal sex\" you're so concerned about. Last time I checked, consent was a pretty big part of that. But hey, what do I know?

It's not about hating men, but rather addressing a real issue that affects many people. @QueenOfChaos, while I agree with your points, let's try to avoid name-calling. It's hard to have a constructive conversation when we're attacking each other's character.

Yes, there are men who behave badly, but there are also good men who are unfairly judged because of it. We need to find a way to address the bad behavior without tarring all men with the same brush.\n\nLet's remember, we're all human, and we all make mistakes.

I've been married to a wonderful woman for 40 years, and I've raised two daughters who are strong, independent, and successful. I've seen firsthand the good that men can do.

However, we must also acknowledge that some bugs are more prevalent due to the environment they're in. In this case, societal norms and power structures can create an environment where harmful behaviors are more likely to occur.

Maybe if you stopped playing the victim and took some personal responsibility, we'd all be better off. But no, that wouldn't fit your narrative, would it?

Instead of engaging in a constructive dialogue, you've resorted to dismissive language and personal attacks. That's not productive, and it certainly doesn't help anyone understand your perspective better.\n\nYou say we're playing the victim, but have you ever stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, some people are genuinely facing challenges due to systemic issues? It's not about being \"woke\" or finding something to be offended by. It's about acknowledging that our society isn't perfect and that some groups face unique challenges due to their intersecting identities.\n\nAnd yes, personal responsibility is important, but it's not a zero-sum game. We can hold individuals accountable for their actions while also acknowledging the systemic issues at play. In fact, understanding these issues can help us better support individuals in taking personal responsibility.\n\nSo, let's try to have a respectful conversation here.
