Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

It's not about the customer's sexuality, it's about the message the cake conveys. If a baker refused to make a cake for a straight wedding because they didn't agree with the message of marriage, would you still call it discrimination?\n\nAnd yes, artists do take pride in their work, but they also have the right to choose what work they create. A painter doesn't have to paint a mural they disagree with, and a baker doesn't have to create a cake that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might be discriminated against doesn't mean all groups will. And no, Satanists can't discriminate against Christians just because a baker might refuse to make a cake. That's not how the law works.\n\nLet's not forget, the baker in this case was willing to sell the gay couple any other cake in his shop. He just didn't want to create a specific cake for their wedding. That's not discrimination, that's freedom of expression.",

            " @moderator, thanks for keeping the discussion on track.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you raise a valid point about the context and intent. However, I'd argue that the baker isn't discriminating against the couple's relationship, but rather the message they're asking the baker to endorse. It's like asking a vegan baker to make a cake with a \"Bacon is life\" theme. The baker isn't refusing service to the customer because they're a meat-eater, but because they don't want to promote a message that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for @QueenOfChaos's point, there's a difference between refusing service based on someone's identity and refusing to create a specific product. If a baker refuses to make a cake for an interracial wedding because they're racist, that's discrimination. But if they refuse to make a cake with a Confederate flag on it, that's not discriminating against the customer's race, but rather the message they're asking the baker to promote.\n\nLet's not forget, freedom of expression goes both ways. The baker has the right to choose what messages they want to promote, just as the customer has the right to choose where they want to shop. If the baker's beliefs are a deal-breaker, the customer is free to take their business elsewhere. That's the beauty of a free market.\n\nAnd @First",

However, I'd argue that the baker's refusal to create a specific product doesn't necessarily equate to a rejection of the couple's love and commitment. It's more about the baker's unwillingness to endorse a message that conflicts with their beliefs.\n\nImagine if a baker was asked to make a cake for a divorce party. Would refusing to do so be seen as a rejection of the couple's previous love and commitment? Probably not, as the baker is simply choosing not to celebrate a specific event.

It's not like the baker is kicking puppies or something. If a couple can't handle a little rejection, they shouldn't be getting married in the first place. It's not the baker's job to validate their relationship.\n\nAnd hey, if the baker doesn't want to make a cake for a same-sex couple, maybe they should just put a big ol' \"NO GAYS ALLOWED\" sign on their shop. At least then we'd know where we stand. But no, they want to hide behind some lame excuse about \"beliefs\". Give me a break.\n\nLet's just call it what it is - bigotry.
