Trying to keep the peace while everyone else is having a real conversation. Well, guess what? Sometimes the truth hurts, and maybe it's time we stop sugarcoating everything.\n\nSo, let's talk about those \"statistics\" and \"perspectives\". How about the fact that immigration has been proven to boost the economy, despite what certain politicians might want you to believe?

Studies have shown that immigrants contribute significantly to our economy, both in terms of taxes paid and the jobs they create. But let's not forget the human aspect of this. These are people, not just economic units. They have dreams, fears, and families just like the rest of us.\n\nAnd @moderator, you're right too. We should keep our language respectful.
