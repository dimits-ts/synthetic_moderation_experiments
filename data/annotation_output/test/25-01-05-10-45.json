Yes, there are double standards, and yes, stereotypes exist, but that doesn't mean we should perpetuate them. By doing so, we're just reinforcing the very issues we're trying to address.\n\nSkin color doesn't determine actions, but systemic issues and societal expectations do. It's not about ignoring the problem, but rather addressing it in a constructive way. Name-calling and derogatory language only serve to escalate tensions and shut down productive dialogue.\n\nLet's not forget that behind every username is a real person with real feelings.
