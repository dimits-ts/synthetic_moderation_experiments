Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's their business, their art, and their choice. You're just trying to force your agenda down everyone's throat. And don't give me that \"protected classes\" nonsense. Black people aren't a choice, being gay is. You're just trying to twist the law to fit your narrative. And hey, if Satanists want to discriminate against Christians, let them. It's a free country, right? But don't expect everyone to roll over and play nice just because you cry \"discrimination\" every time someone doesn't agree with you. Grow a spine, snowflake.",

            " @DarkShadow333, you're right that it's about principle, but let's not forget that principles should be fair and just. The baker's right to refuse service ends where another person's right to equal treatment begins. It's not about forcing an agenda, it's about ensuring everyone is treated equally under the law. And yes, being gay is a choice in the same way being straight is - it's not a choice, it's who we are. As for Satanists discriminating against Christians, that's a slippery slope. If we allow that, where does it stop? Let's not open that can of worms.\n\n@FirstUser, you're right that if the baker doesn't ask, he could unknowingly be supporting a gay wedding. But that's a risk he takes by being in business. He can't pick and choose who he serves based on his personal beliefs if it infringes on someone else's rights. And yes, the bible has been used to justify some pretty awful things throughout history. Let's not add to that list.\n\nAnd @moderator, thanks for keeping us in line.

If a baker can refuse service to a gay couple, what's to stop a business from refusing service to interracial couples, or even single mothers? The law is designed to protect everyone, not just those who align with a particular belief system.\n\nAs for the \"choice\" argument, sexual orientation is not a choice, just as being heterosexual is not a choice. It's a fundamental aspect of who we are. The American Psychological Association has stated that most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.\n\nAnd @TechGuru88, well said.

The baker's right to freedom of religion is indeed important, but it's not absolute. When a business opens its doors to the public, it's subject to certain laws and regulations that protect all customers equally. The baker is free to practice their religion, but they can't use it as a justification to discriminate against others. As for the \"choice\" argument, it's not about parroting what we've been told, but rather, it's about understanding the scientific consensus. The American Psychological Association, among other reputable organizations, has concluded that sexual orientation is not a choice. Let's focus on the facts and the principles at play, rather than dismissing each other's views. We can have a productive conversation if we approach it with an open mind and a willingness to listen.",

It's like saying a doctor can refuse to treat someone because of their religion. It's not about throwing anyone's rights out the window, it's about ensuring everyone is treated equally under the law.
