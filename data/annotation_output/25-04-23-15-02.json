      "@SarcasticTechBro92, I understand where you're coming from, but I think @RebelliousTeen44 has a point. The term terrorist is often used to stereotype and demonize certain groups based on their appearance or ethnicity. It's not about being brown enough, but about how society perceives and treats people based on their skin color. It's a complex issue, and reducing it to actions, not skin color oversimplifies the problem. Let's try to have a nuanced discussion about this, without resorting to dismissive comments or assumptions.",

You can't just dismiss someone's experience because it doesn't fit your narrow view of the world.
