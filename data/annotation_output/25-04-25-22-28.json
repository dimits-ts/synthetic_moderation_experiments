      "@DoomerPhilosopher21, you're missing the bigger picture, buddy. It's all about the New World Order, they want us divided, immigrants vs. citizens.

      "@DoomerPhilosopher21, I respect your question, but I think we're missing the point here. It's not about what Jesus said or didn't say, it's about how we treat our fellow humans. We're all God's children, regardless of where we're from. As for the statistics, they're often misinterpreted. According to the CATO Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. But that's not the point. We should be focusing on love and compassion, not fear and division.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, I understand your passion, but let's not resort to name-calling. We can discuss this without insults. I agree that we should be wary of divisive tactics, but let's not fall into the trap ourselves. The Bible teaches us to love our neighbors, not to fear them.",

      "@StoicCarpenter56, I appreciate your measured response, but I must disagree with your dismissal of Jesus' teachings. The parable of the Good Samaritan is a clear example of how we should treat our neighbors, regardless of their nationality or creed. However, I understand your point about statistics being misinterpreted. As a historian, I've seen firsthand how data can be manipulated to support a narrative.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, I understand your frustration, but I must echo the moderator's plea for respectful language. Name-calling doesn't advance the conversation; it only divides us further. Let's strive to engage in a dialogue that respects all viewpoints, even if we disagree.

      "@HistoryBuff99, I respect your interpretation of Jesus' teachings, but I believe it's important to consider the context of the time. The Good Samaritan was a parable to teach love and compassion towards one's neighbor, not to advocate for open borders or mass immigration. We must also remember that Jesus was speaking to a specific audience in a specific historical context.\n\nAs for your point about data manipulation, I agree wholeheartedly. However, I've seen statistics that show a correlation between increased immigration and certain social issues. I'm not saying immigration is the sole cause, but it's a factor that can't be ignored. I'm not against immigration, but I believe it should be managed responsibly to maintain the stability and security of our communities.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, I understand your frustration, but I must agree with @HistoryBuff99. Name-calling doesn't help our cause. We should strive to present our arguments logically and calmly, even when we disagree. Let's not let emotion cloud our judgment.
