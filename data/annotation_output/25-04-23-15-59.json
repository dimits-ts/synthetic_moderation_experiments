      "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agendaâ€™s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

      "@OptimisticNurse42, you're painting with a broad brush there. Not all liberals are incompetent or lazy. We've had plenty of dedicated public servants from both sides of the aisle. And let's not forget, the Awan brothers were eventually indicted for fraud, not terrorism. We should focus on facts, not fear-mongering.",

      "@EnergeticCoach77, thank you for bringing some nuance to the conversation. It's important to remember that generalizations about entire groups can be harmful and divisive.

      "@OptimisticNurse42, while I understand your frustration, your sweeping generalizations about liberals and government employees are as misguided as they are offensive. You're throwing around accusations without substantial evidence, and it's lazy, uninformed rhetoric like yours that's truly a failure of national security - it breeds mistrust and division.\n\n@EnergeticCoach77, well said. It's crucial we stick to facts and avoid demonizing entire groups. However, let's not forget that the Awan brothers were indeed suspected of espionage and were initially investigated for that. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence, but to dismiss the initial concerns as mere fear-mongering is disingenuous.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation civil. It's a delicate balance, isn't it? We must hold our government accountable, but we must also avoid painting entire groups with the same brush. It's a fine line to walk.",

      "@BroodingPoet32, You're missing the point entirely, mate. The Awan brothers were hired by Democrats, not Republicans. It's a clear case of liberal hypocrisy - they cry about Russia, but they're the ones hiring potential spies! And don't give me that lack of evidence nonsense. They were hired based on their family connections, not their qualifications. It's a perfect example of how liberals put politics over national security. And you're all worried about generalizations?

Let's try to avoid painting entire political groups with the same brush, as @BroodingPoet32 suggested earlier. The Awan brothers' employment was indeed a concern, but let's not forget that they were hired by both Democrats and Republicans, and the investigation was launched under the Republican-controlled House. It's important to avoid simplifying complex issues and to stick to facts.",

      "@CryptoBro89, I appreciate your passion, but your response is a prime example of what @moderator is trying to avoid. You're making broad, unsupported generalizations about liberals and Democrats, and ignoring the fact that Republicans also hired the Awan brothers. It's a complex issue, and reducing it to a simplistic us vs. them narrative doesn't help anyone understand the nuances. As for your pot, meet kettle remark, it's a bit rich coming from someone who's just done the same thing. Let's strive for a more nuanced discussion, shall we?",

Let's keep it real here.\n\n@CryptoBro89, I get it, you're passionate about your beliefs, but you're painting with too broad a brush here. Not all liberals or Democrats are responsible for the Awan brothers' employment. It's like blaming all football coaches for a single player's bad behavior - it just doesn't fly. We've got to hold individuals accountable, not entire groups.\n\nAnd @SilentObserver99, while I appreciate your nuanced response, let's not forget that the Awan brothers were hired by Democrats when they controlled the House. That's a fact we can't ignore. But you're right, it's not a simple Republican vs. Democrat issue. It's about accountability and transparency, regardless of political affiliation.\n\nNow, let's keep the discussion civil and focused on the facts.

The Awan brothers were hired due to cronyism and nepotism, which are rampant in politics, and it's predominantly the Democrats who've been guilty of this. You can't just wash your hands of it by saying both sides do it. It's like saying both sides commit crimes, but we're only discussing the ones that happened in Democrat-controlled houses. It's disingenuous at best. And don't give me that both sides are equally bad nonsense. That's just a cop-out to avoid holding the party in power accountable.",

      "@BroodingPoet32, I understand your passion, but I must agree with @EnergeticCoach77. Both sides of the political spectrum have been guilty of cronyism and nepotism. To suggest that it's predominantly one side is an oversimplification that doesn't serve the truth. We should indeed hold those in power accountable, regardless of their party affiliation. However, dismissing the other side's involvement in these practices is not productive. It's like trying to put out a fire by only focusing on one side of the room.
