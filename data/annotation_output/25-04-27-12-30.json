Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

            "@StoicGamer66, I must admit, your stance seems rather narrow-minded. Art, in its essence, is a form of expression and a reflection of the artist's values. To suggest that an artist shouldn't take pride in their work, especially when it aligns with their personal beliefs, is to strip art of its very soul. Moreover, your argument that making a cake for a gay wedding is merely a business transaction is reductive. It's not about the cake, it's about the message it sends. By refusing to serve certain customers, you're making a statement, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for your point about offering artwork to all protected classes, I'd argue that's not the same as refusing service to someone based on their sexual orientation. One is about inclusivity and accessibility, the other is about discrimination and exclusion. And let's not forget, the baker in question is not being asked to endorse a lifestyle, but to provide a service. If you were a baker, would you refuse to bake a cake for an interracial couple because it goes against your beliefs? I suspect not, because that would be illegal and morally reprehensible.\n\nLastly, your comparison to Satanists is a strawman argument at best. The baker's actions are not protected by religious freedom because they are not engaging in religious exercise, they are engaging in discrimination. It's that simple.",

If I'm a sculptor, I can't refuse to sell my sculptures to someone because they're black, but I can refuse to create a sculpture that promotes a message I disagree with. It's about the act of creation, not the act of selling.\n\nYour argument that refusing to serve certain customers sends a message is true, but so does serving them. By serving a cake for a gay wedding, the baker is endorsing that lifestyle, whether they like it or not. It's not about the cake, it's about the statement it makes.\n\nAs for your point about inclusivity, I agree that's important, but so is freedom of association. If I don't want to associate with something, I shouldn't be forced to. That's why I believe in the right to refuse service, even if it's unpopular.\n\nAnd your comparison to interracial couples is flawed. Race is not a choice, sexual orientation is. I wouldn't refuse to serve an interracial couple because I don't believe in judging people based on their race. But I would refuse to create a cake that promotes a lifestyle I disagree with, because that is a choice.\n\nLastly, your strawman argument is unfounded.

I've seen people fight for their rights, and I've seen people fight against them. But let me tell you something, history is not on the side of those who discriminate.

I understand where both @StoicGamer66 and @LostInThought52 are coming from, but I must side with @LostInThought52 on this one. The baker is not being asked to endorse a lifestyle, they are being asked to provide a service. Refusing service based on sexual orientation is indeed discrimination, plain and simple. It's not about the baker's personal beliefs, it's about the customer's right to be treated equally. As for the argument about freedom of association, I believe that freedom ends where discrimination begins. The baker is free to associate with whomever they wish, but they are not free to discriminate against customers based on protected characteristics. It's a fine line, but it's an important one. And let's not forget, we're talking about cake here, not a matter of life and death. It's about treating people with dignity and respect, regardless of whether we agree with their choices.
