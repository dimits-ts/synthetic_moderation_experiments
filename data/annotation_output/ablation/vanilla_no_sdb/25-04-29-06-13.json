            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            "@SilentObserver99, I appreciate your attempt at keeping the conversation civil, but your response is as naive as it is misguided. You're telling me to focus on facts while ignoring the mountain of evidence that shows liberal bias in our government? The Awan brothers, the Clinton email scandal, the Obama administration's cozying up to the Muslim Brotherhood - these aren't just isolated incidents, they're part of a pattern. And don't even get me started on the laziness and incompetence of our bloated, unionized bureaucracy. You can't tell me that's not a fact, because it is. And if you think that's not a result of liberal policies, then you're living in a fantasy world.",

            "@CynicalInvestor88, I must admit, your response is a bit of a history lesson itself, but one that's riddled with cherry-picked events and a distinct lack of context. The Awan brothers' case was a single instance of misconduct, not a sign of widespread liberal bias. The Clinton email scandal was investigated thoroughly, and no charges were brought against her. As for the Obama administration's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, it was a matter of diplomatic engagement, not cozying up. And the bloated, unionized bureaucracy you speak of is a result of decades of bipartisan policy, not just liberal ones.\n\nNow, I'm not saying there isn't bias or incompetence in our government. That's a given in any large, complex organization. But to attribute it all to liberals is not only simplistic, but also ignores the significant contributions and failures of conservatives as well.\n\nAs for your tone, @moderator is right. We're here to discuss facts, not to attack individuals or groups. Let's keep the conversation civil and focused, shall we?",
