The Bible may not explicitly mention immigration rights, but it does talk about treating strangers and foreigners with kindness and respect. It's not about quoting a specific verse, but rather about applying the principles of compassion and empathy to our daily lives.\n\nAs for your question about murders committed by illegal aliens in California, I'd like to see some credible sources to back up those claims. It's easy to throw around statistics, but without context and evidence, they're meaningless.

Throwing out unsubstantiated claims about murders committed by illegal aliens in California does nothing to advance the conversation. @QuietThinker92 is right; without credible sources, those claims are nothing but hot air. And let's be real, even if you could provide some stats, correlation does not imply causation. I'd love to see some actual data and analysis rather than sensationalist rhetoric. @QuietThinker92, I appreciate your emphasis on compassion and empathy, but let's not forget that we're also talking about the rule of law here.
