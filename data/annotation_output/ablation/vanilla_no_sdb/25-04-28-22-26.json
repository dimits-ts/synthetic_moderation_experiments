It's important to acknowledge that these issues exist and affect many women, regardless of whether it's typical or not. And when you dismiss her concerns as misandry, you're ignoring the real pain and fear that many women live with every day.

I'm a personal trainer, I work with all kinds of people, men and women, and I've seen firsthand that both sexes can be victims and perpetrators of harassment. It's not a women's issue or a men's issue, it's a human issue. And when people start throwing around words like misandry without any evidence, it just makes it harder for everyone to have a real conversation.

It's a real issue, just as real as misogyny, and it's often overlooked because of the systemic advantages men hold in our society. To dismiss it as a non-issue or to equate it to misogyny is to ignore the unique challenges men face. Let's not fall into the trap of whataboutism. We can acknowledge both issues without diminishing either.",

Men have held the power for centuries, and while I'm not dismissing the struggles men face, it's a fact that women have been systemically oppressed. We can't ignore that. It's like saying a rich kid has it tough because they don't get a new toy every day. Yes, they have problems, but they're not the same as a kid who's struggling to eat.

Both have valid issues, and acknowledging one doesn't negate the other. Systemic oppression against women is indeed real and should be addressed, but that doesn't mean we should dismiss or ignore the challenges faced by men. It's not a competition of who's had it worse; it's about understanding that everyone's experiences are valid and complex.",
