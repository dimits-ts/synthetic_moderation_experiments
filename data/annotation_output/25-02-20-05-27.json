There are many styles, but each has a foundation in proven techniques. Deviating too much can hinder progress and self-defense. Similarly, in society, certain norms exist for a reason, to maintain order and harmony.

Marriage has evolved to become more inclusive and equitable, allowing for a wider range of relationships to be recognized and celebrated. That's not to say it's perfect now, but it's certainly an improvement from where it started.\n\nAnd while natural selection does play a role, it's not the only factor shaping societies. Culture, technology, and communication have accelerated our ability to adapt and cooperate in ways that weren't possible in the past. So, yes, adaptability and resilience are key, but so is empathy and understanding.\n\nAs for your point about romanticizing the past, I think you're projecting a bit. I never said societies were perfect in the past, just that they've evolved in ways that have allowed for more diversity and acceptance. And that's something worth celebrating, even if it's not a perfect process.\n\n@moderator, I think SilentObserver99's point about the evolution of marriage is a great example.
