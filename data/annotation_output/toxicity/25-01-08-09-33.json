If we want to make the world a better place, we need to consider those feelings and treat each other with respect. Calling a spade a spade is one thing, but throwing around baseless accusations and stereotypes is quite another. It's not about being 'woke', it's about being decent human beings.

            " @QueenOfChaos, I see you're quite passionate about your views, but I must disagree with your approach. The truth does indeed matter, but so does the manner in which we present it. Blindly hurling accusations without evidence isn't courageous, it's irresponsible. It's like shouting fire in a crowded theater - it causes panic and chaos, not constructive change.\n\nYou say the truth doesn't need evidence, but that's a slippery slope. Without evidence, how do we distinguish truth from mere opinion or prejudice? And while feelings shouldn't dictate facts, they do matter. People are more likely to listen and change when they feel respected, not attacked.\n\nAs for the real world not caring about politically correct nonsense, I'd argue that's exactly what it needs more of - correctness, politeness, and respect. The world is complex and nuanced, and simplistic, harsh views often do more harm than good. Let's not confuse harshness with honesty, and let's not dismiss the power of civil discourse. After all, change often comes from understanding and empathy, not just harsh words.",

You can't just go around hurting people's feelings and expect them to listen to you. That's not how you change minds or hearts. I've seen a lot in my 66 years, and I can tell you, the world doesn't need more harshness, it needs more kindness and understanding. We're all just trying to get along in this world, and a little respect goes a long way. So, let's try to have a conversation like adults, not like we're in a schoolyard shouting match.",

Sure, sometimes harsh truths need to be told, but there's a time and a place for everything. Your 'grow a spine' attitude might work in a action movie, but in real life, it's just alienating. And no, the truth doesn't need evidence to be true, but if you can't back it up, how do you expect anyone to believe you? It's not about being politically correct, it's about being logically correct. And as for the'real world' not caring about politeness, well, maybe that's why it's in such a mess. A little civility goes a long way, and it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of intelligence. So, let's not confuse harshness with honesty, and let's not dismiss the power of a well-reasoned argument. After all, even the harshest truths can be delivered with kindness.",
