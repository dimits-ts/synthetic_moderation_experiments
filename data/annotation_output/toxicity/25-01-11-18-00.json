Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

The baker's right to refuse service is indeed a complex issue, but it's important to consider the broader implications. If a business is open to the public, it should serve all members of the public, regardless of their personal characteristics. This is not about the baker's pride in his cakes, but about equal access to goods and services.\n\nAs for the baker's religious beliefs, they should not be used to discriminate against others. The baker is free to practice his religion, but that does not give him the right to impose his beliefs on others or to refuse service based on those beliefs.\n\nLet's not forget that this is not just about a cake, but about the dignity and rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. By refusing to serve a gay couple, the baker is sending a message that their love and commitment are less valid than those of heterosexual couples. That's not just disappointing, it's hurtful and harmful.\n\nLet's strive for understanding and compassion, rather than dismissing each other's views. After all, we're all just trying to navigate this complex world together.",

This isn't about the baker's pride in his cakes, but about equal access to goods and services.\n\n@WiseOwl71, I completely agree with you. The baker's religious beliefs should not be used to discriminate against others. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.

            " @QueenOfChaos, you're really reaching with that Jesus is just disappointed line. If Jesus was here, he'd probably be more upset about the hypocrisy of cherry-picking which parts of the Bible to follow. Last time surely checked, he was all about love and acceptance, not turning people away based on who they love. And let's not forget, he was pretty clear about the whole judge not, lest ye be judged thing.\n\n@WiseOwl71, spot on. This isn't about the baker's feelings or beliefs, it's about the couple's right to be treated equally. If the baker can't handle that, maybe he should find a different line of work.\n\n@doing_my_best24, well said. Let's not forget, this isn't just about a cake, it's about the message it sends.
