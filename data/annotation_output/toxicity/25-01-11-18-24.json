Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

If a business can refuse service to someone based on their sexual orientation, where does it stop? What's next, refusing service to interracial couples because some people believe it's against their religion? We've seen this before, and it's not okay. And @GoldenYears66, you're right, the baker shouldn't have to ask everyone about their sexuality. But if they know the cake is for a same-sex wedding and refuse to make it, that's discrimination, plain and simple. Let's not forget, love is love, and everyone deserves to be treated equally.",

He refused to create a custom cake for their wedding, which is a different matter. Artists have the right to choose what kind of art they create, and in this case, the baker saw the cake as an expression of his art. It's a complex issue, and we should be careful not to oversimplify it.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, while I understand your frustration, calling someone a snowflake is indeed dismissive and disrespectful. Let's try to keep our language civil, even when we disagree.\n\n@doing_my_best24, you raise a valid concern about where this could lead. However, we should also consider the slippery slope argument.
