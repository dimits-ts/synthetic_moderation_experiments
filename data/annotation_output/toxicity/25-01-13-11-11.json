The fact that you're reducing complex issues to simple terms like dramatic or playing the victim shows a lack of empathy and understanding.\n\nI've seen firsthand how some men can behave inappropriately, and it's not because women are sensitive or dramatic. It's because there's a culture that allows and even encourages such behavior. We should be teaching both men and women about respect and boundaries, not just placing the burden on one gender.\n\nAs for the woke agenda, it's not about silencing anyone. It's about giving a voice to those who have been silenced for too long. Let's not dismiss valid concerns just because they make us uncomfortable. That's not how we grow and learn as a society.",
