            "How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's a subtle but important distinction. If a customer asked for a cake with a swastika, would you force the baker to make it? Freedom of speech and religion protect the baker's right to choose what messages he promotes. As for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might misuse a law doesn't mean it's not valid. Let's not stoop to name-calling, it doesn't help the discussion. Let's try to understand each other's perspectives, shall we?",

It's not just about the message, it's about who's getting married. And @QueenOfChaos, the baker's right to choose who he does business with ends where discrimination begins. If he doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding, that's fine, but he should just say so without hiding behind religion. As for the slippery slope, it's not a fallacy if it's a real concern. Once we start allowing discrimination based on beliefs, it's a slippery slope indeed. And @DarkShadow333, a cake can indeed be a form of expression, but that's not the point.
