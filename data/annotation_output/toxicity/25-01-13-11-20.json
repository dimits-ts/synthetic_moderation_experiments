And the fact that Huma's family has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is well-documented, not just a right-wing conspiracy theory. As for the Awans, the fact that they had access to sensitive information despite their lack of experience and potential ties to Pakistan is concerning, regardless of whether those ties are proven.\n\n@doing_my_best24, you're not wrong about the laziness and political bias in government, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Not all government employees are lazy or biased. And unions aren't the root of all evil either. They serve a purpose in protecting workers' rights.\n\nLet's focus on the facts and have a productive discussion.

However, I think we also need to be careful not to jump to conclusions based on incomplete information. The Awans' case is still ongoing, and we should let the legal process play out before making definitive statements. As for the systemic issues, I agree that we need to have a real discussion about how to fix them.

But I've seen enough in my years to know that sometimes, the system moves too slow or doesn't move at all. We can't just sit back and wait for something to happen. We need to be proactive in addressing these issues. And you're right, many government employees are dedicated, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the ones who aren't. A few bad apples can still spoil the bunch if we don't deal with them. We need to hold everyone accountable, not just the ones who make the headlines.

The Awans are guilty as sin, and anyone who thinks otherwise is either naive or in denial. And as for the'system', it's a joke. A corrupt, broken joke. You can't fix something that's fundamentally flawed. You're both just wasting your time with your'reforms' and 'accountability'. The system will eat you alive, mark my words.
