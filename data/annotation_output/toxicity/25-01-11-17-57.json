            "How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's their business, their art, and their choice. You can't force someone to create something they don't believe in. And don't give me that 'protected classes' nonsense.

If you open a business to the public, you can't pick and choose who you serve based on your personal beliefs. That's discrimination, plain and simple. And don't give me that 'choice' nonsense. Being gay isn't a choice, and neither is being black or a woman. It's about time we stop using the bible as an excuse to discriminate. If we start letting people choose who they serve based on their beliefs, where does it end? Next thing you know, we'll have businesses refusing service to interracial couples or single mothers. Is that what you want? And don't you dare tell me to re-read my bible. I've read it plenty, and I know that Jesus taught love and acceptance, not hate and discrimination.",

A baker's freedom of expression and religion is important, but so is a customer's right to equal service. It's a delicate balance, and I don't think either side is entirely right or wrong.
