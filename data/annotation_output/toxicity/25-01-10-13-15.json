Seems like we're supposed to be more concerned with the content of someone's character than the color of their passport. And @QueenOfChaos, you're spot on. Let's not forget that fear-mongering and hate have no place in a society that claims to be built on Christian values. We should be looking at the root causes of crime, not just scapegoating immigrants. Let's have a real conversation about this, not just throw statistics around to suit our agendas. ",

It's not about statistics or fear-mongering, but about compassion and understanding. Let's not forget that many of these 'illegal aliens' are seeking a better life, just like our ancestors did. @QueenOfChaos, you raise a valid point about white supremacist violence, but let's not counter hate with hate.

Like the fact that the majority of undocumented immigrants are actually law-abiding people just trying to make a living. Or the fact that studies have shown that areas with higher immigration rates actually have lower crime rates. But nah, let's just keep throwing out baseless claims and scapegoating immigrants, right?

Change takes time, and it often starts with small steps. We can't just snap our fingers and fix everything overnight. But by fostering open dialogue and empathy, we're planting seeds that can grow into something meaningful. As for feeling good about ourselves, I'd argue that's a byproduct of trying to make a difference, not the goal. So, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

And @QueenOfChaos, while your skepticism might be warranted, it's also important to remember that progress isn't always linear. Sometimes, it's two steps forward, one step back. But that doesn't mean we should stop moving forward. As for feeling good about ourselves, I think it's a natural byproduct of doing what we believe is right.
