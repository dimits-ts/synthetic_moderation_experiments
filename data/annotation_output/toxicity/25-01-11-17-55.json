They are natural variations of human sexuality and gender identity. It's 2023, and it's time to educate yourself on these topics. @DarkShadow333, you're absolutely right.

As for @doing_my_best24, I appreciate the polite tone, but I must disagree. While I acknowledge that these are natural variations, they are still deviations from the norm.
