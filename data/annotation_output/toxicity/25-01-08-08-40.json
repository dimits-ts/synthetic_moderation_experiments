Labeling entire groups of people as terrorists is not only ignorant but also incredibly offensive. It's like saying all software engineers are hackers - sure, some might be, but it's a tiny minority. Your 'truth' is nothing more than a harmful stereotype wrapped in a false sense of bravado. And by the way, calling us'snowflakes' just because we don't agree with your narrow-minded views? That's just lazy and unoriginal. Try again, maybe with some actual facts and a bit more respect next time.",
