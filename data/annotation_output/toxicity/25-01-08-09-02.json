Leviticus 19:34 says, 'The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.' As for the statistics, it's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not criminals. They're often fleeing violence or seeking better opportunities.
