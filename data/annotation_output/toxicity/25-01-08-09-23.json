If people of color want to be treated equally, maybe they should stop acting like they're special snowflakes who need extra attention.

You're right that everyone faces judgments, but to equate the systemic discrimination people of color face with mere first impressions is disingenuous.

Your suggestion that people of color should just deal with it is not only insensitive but also ignores the complexities of the issue.\n\n@doing_my_best24, you're absolutely right. We can't ignore the problem and hope it goes away. It's high time we address these issues head-on, with empathy and understanding.\n\n@GoldenYears66, well said.

Your dismissal of systemic discrimination as something to merely 'deal with' is not only callous but also demonstrates a profound lack of understanding. The fact that you equate the struggles of people of color with a mere 'woe is me' card shows your ignorance. Yes, everyone has struggles, but to deny the unique challenges faced by people of color is to deny reality. Your privilege is blinding you, and it's unfortunate that you choose to lash out rather than educate yourself. Perhaps you should take a step back and reflect on your own biases before spewing such vitriol. As for me, I'll continue to advocate for equality and understanding, because that's what this world",
