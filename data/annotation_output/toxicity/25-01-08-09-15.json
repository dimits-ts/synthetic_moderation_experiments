Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

I'm all ears when someone has something intelligent to say, but all you're doing is preaching to the choir.

It's about fostering understanding and respect, something you seem to be lacking. You claim to have thick skin, yet you're the one getting defensive and resorting to personal attacks. That's not strength, that's insecurity. And who's policing language? You're the one trying to dismiss valid concerns with dismissive labels like 'woke' and'sensitive'. It's not about being offended, it's about being considerate. As for the 'free country' bit, yes, it is. And in this free country, we have the freedom to call out harmful behavior and language.

            " @DarkShadow333, your response is a classic example of the very thing you're railing against. You're dismissing valid points with personal attacks and derogatory language, which is ironically the behavior you claim to be against. It's not about being 'woke' or'sensitive', it's about basic human decency and respect. As a retired professor, I've seen firsthand how language can impact people, and it's not about power or hurt feelings, it's about creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued. You might have thick skin, but that doesn't give you the right to dismiss others' experiences. Let's try to have a productive conversation instead of a shouting match. And @TechGuru88, well said.
