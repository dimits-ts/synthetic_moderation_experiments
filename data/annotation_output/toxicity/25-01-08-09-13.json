However, the fact remains that the majority of sexual assaults are committed by men. It's important to acknowledge that and work towards changing the culture that allows this to happen. Let's not dismiss the issue just because it makes us uncomfortable. We should be promoting healthy, consensual sex, not denying the problem.",

It's not a joke, and it's certainly not something to be brushed off as a small price for 'equality'. Your attitude is part of the problem, not the solution.\n\n@DarkShadow333, your response is just as bad. Calling people'snowflakes' for wanting a respectful conversation is childish and ignorant. This isn't about policing fun, it's about creating a safe space for everyone. The internet might not be a church, but it's also not a place where people should feel threatened or disrespected.\n\n@moderator, thank you for stepping in and trying to maintain a respectful conversation.
