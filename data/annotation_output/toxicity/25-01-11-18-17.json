            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            " Oh, please. @GoldenYears66, you're just parroting Fox News talking points. Hillary Clinton didn't give Huma Abedin a security clearance, the State Department did. And your anti-American newspaper claim is just a right-wing conspiracy theory. As for the Awans, there's no evidence they had ties to terrorist groups. You're just spewing baseless accusations. Typical of someone who thinks liberal is a dirty word. Maybe if you spent less time watching Tucker Carlson and more time reading actual news, you'd have a clue. But hey, it's easier to blame lazy liberals than to admit that maybe, just maybe, the system is broken because of people like you who can't think for themselves. \ud83d\ude44",

            " @QueenOfChaos, you're just another liberal snowflake who can't handle the truth. I don't watch Fox News, I read the facts. Huma Abedin's family has well-documented ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and her mother's newspaper has published anti-American articles. As for the Awans, the evidence is there if you'd bother to look. But you're too busy drinking the liberal Kool-Aid to see it. And don't you dare lecture me about thinking for myself. I've been around longer than you, sweetheart. I've seen this country go from great to a laughing stock under liberal leadership. So, keep your smug attitude and your actual news to yourself. I'll stick to the facts, thank you very much.",

            " @GoldenYears66, let's not get carried away with personal attacks. We're all here to discuss and learn, not to insult each other. The issue of security clearances is indeed complex and deserves a thorough examination. It's true that the State Department, not Hillary Clinton personally, granted Huma Abedin's clearance. However, the concerns about her family's ties are valid and should have been thoroughly investigated. Similarly, the Awans' case raises questions about the vetting process. But let's not jump to conclusions without solid evidence. We need a fair and unbiased investigation, not just assumptions based on political leanings. Let's strive for a productive conversation, shall we?",

And the fact is, our security clearance process is a joke. It's been politicized and watered down to the point where people with questionable ties are getting access to sensitive information. I'm not saying everyone with a clearance is a terrorist, but we can't just ignore the red flags. And yes, we need a thorough investigation, but that's not happening. The system is broken, and it",

However, I think it's important to acknowledge that there are valid concerns about the security clearance process. The fact that Huma Abedin's family has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is something that should have been thoroughly investigated. Similarly, the Awans' case raises important questions about the vetting process. We need to address these issues openly and honestly, without dismissing them as conspiracy theories or right-wing propaganda.

The security clearance process is indeed a complex issue that deserves our attention. It's crucial to ensure that those with access to sensitive information are thoroughly vetted, regardless of their political affiliations. We should demand transparency and accountability from our government, and that includes a fair and unbiased investigation into any potential security risks.
