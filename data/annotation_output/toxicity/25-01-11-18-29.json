And who says I dress like a'slut'? Last time I checked, my wardrobe choices don't give anyone the right to touch me without consent. But hey, keep blaming the victims, it's a classic move. Maybe if you spent less time worrying about what other people wear and more time educating yourself, you'd understand that.

Not all men are part of the problem, and many are actively working to change the system. @QueenOfChaos, your victim-blaming is exactly what's wrong with this conversation. No one, regardless of what they wear, deserves to be attacked. Let's focus on the real issue here: consent and respect. And @DarkShadow333, while the system needs to change, let's not dismiss the importance of individual actions and accountability. It's a complex issue, and we need to tackle it from all angles.",

And @QueenOfChaos, dressing a certain way doesn't give anyone the right to disrespect or harm you. That's just plain wrong. But @DarkShadow333, while the system does need to change, let's not forget that change starts with us. We all have a part to play in this, men and women alike. We need to teach our kids, our friends, our family about consent and respect. And we need to hold those who cross the line accountable, regardless of their gender. It's not about 'precious masculinity', it's about basic human decency. Let's not let this conversation turn into a blame game. We're all in this together.",

We need to foster a culture of respect and consent, and that starts with education and personal accountability. Let's not forget, change is a two-way street. While the system needs to adapt, individuals also need to step up and do their part. It's not about 'us vs them', it's about 'us' working together to create a safer, more respectful world.",

When folks like @QueenOfChaos try to derail the conversation with their narrow-minded views. They're so busy pointing fingers, they forget to look in the mirror. It's like they're stuck in the past, refusing to see that the world is changing. We've got to educate ourselves and each other, and that includes calling out those who refuse to evolve. It's not about being politically correct, it's about being decent human beings.
