In fact, the Israelites were once strangers in Egypt. As for the statistics, let's not cherry-pick data to fuel fear. According to a study by the Cato Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Let's focus on facts, not fear-mongering. @GoldenYears66, well said.

It's clear you're more interested in maintaining your narrative than engaging in a productive conversation. The Cato Institute is not a liberal think tank; it's a libertarian one, known for its rigorous research. But even if it were, the validity of a study doesn't depend on the political leanings of its source. It's about the methodology and data.\n\nYou keep harping on about real threats, but you've yet to provide any concrete evidence to support your claims. Instead, you're content to hide behind vague generalizations and ad hominem attacks. That's not protecting your family or your country; that's fear-mongering.\n\nAnd @GoldenYears66, you're absolutely right. Fear is a powerful tool, but it's a poor guide for policy.
