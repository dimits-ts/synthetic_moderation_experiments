No one, regardless of their attire or behavior, deserves to be harassed or assaulted. Your simple cause and effect argument is a dangerous oversimplification that ignores the complexities of human behavior and the power dynamics at play.\n\nMoreover, the #YesAllWomen movement is not about hating men; it's about acknowledging the pervasive nature of harassment and assault that women face. It's about creating a safer world for everyone, not about demonizing any particular group.\n\nYour repeated use of inflammatory language and dismissive attitude is not conducive to a productive conversation. If you're genuinely interested in understanding these issues, I encourage you to approach the topic with more empathy and open-mindedness. Otherwise, perhaps it's best to step back and let others engage in a more constructive dialogue.",
