We can't just ignore the crimes committed by some immigrants, but neither can we demonize all of them.

However, he did say, Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. (Matthew 25:40) So, maybe instead of focusing on the crimes of a few, we should be more concerned with helping the many who are just seeking a better life.\n\n@DarkShadow333, you're spot on about the lower crime rates among immigrants. But let's not forget that fear and misinformation are powerful tools. People like @FirstUser are often more afraid of what they don't understand than the actual facts.\n\n@WiseOwl71, you're right about respecting the law, but laws can be unjust. Throughout history, laws have been used to oppress and discriminate. Maybe it's time we reevaluate our immigration laws and make them more humane and compassionate.\n\n@GoldenYears66, well said. Love and protection should go hand in hand. But let's not forget, the most vulnerable are often the ones who are demonized and scapegoated. It's our responsibility to stand up for them, not against them.\n\nAnd @FirstUser, if you're so concerned about crime, maybe you should look into the crimes committed by corporations and the wealthy. They're doing a lot more harm than any immigrant ever could. But hey, that's just my two cents.",

We can't just ignore the fact that some immigrants do commit crimes. It's not about the color of their skin, but about the actions of individuals. And yes, addressing the root causes of crime is crucial. It's like fixing a software bug - you can't just patch the symptom, you need to find and fix the underlying issue. But let's not forget, we also need to protect our own citizens. It's like writing secure code - you want to be open and welcoming, but you also need to have safeguards in place.
