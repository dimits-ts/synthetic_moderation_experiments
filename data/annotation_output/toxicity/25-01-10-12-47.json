But let's not forget, the vast majority of people from those regions are peaceful. So, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater, okay?

The issue here is that @FirstUser's comment plays into a harmful stereotype, whether they meant it or not. It's like saying, He's not black enough to be a criminal, which is equally problematic. We should be challenging these stereotypes, not reinforcing them. Let's strive for a world where people are judged by their actions, not their skin color or ethnicity.",
