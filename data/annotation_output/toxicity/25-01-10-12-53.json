Yes, not all men are sex offenders, but that doesn't negate the fact that the majority of sexual assaults are indeed committed by men.

I've been volunteering at the local youth center for years, teaching kids about respect and consent. So, yes, I'm going to keep on talking about it, and I'm going to keep on doing something about it.
