Throughout history, what was once considered 'normal' has changed drastically. Take, for instance, the idea of women voting or interracial marriage - once seen as deviations, now widely accepted. Homosexuality and being transgender are natural expressions of human diversity. They've been documented throughout history and across cultures. Let's not forget, it's our differences that make us unique and interesting. I agree with @doing_my_best24, understanding and acceptance are key.

However, we also need to be cautious about romanticizing the past. Some traditions have persisted because they've been beneficial, but others have stuck around due to inertia or lack of challenge. It's important to question and evaluate all traditions, even those that have been around for a long time.
