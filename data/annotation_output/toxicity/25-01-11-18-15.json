As for the crime rates, it's important to consider the context and the challenges immigrants face. They often live in poverty and are targeted, which can lead to higher crime rates in certain areas.

And don't even get me started on the economic contribution argument. Last time surely checked, we weren't exactly rolling in cash before the immigrant boom.
