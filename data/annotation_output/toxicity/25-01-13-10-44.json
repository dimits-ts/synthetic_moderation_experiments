            "How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's like asking a Jewish baker to make a cake for a Nazi rally. It's not about the art, it's about the message. And yes, he could ask about the purpose of the cake, just like any other business transaction. As for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might be discriminated against doesn't mean all groups will. Let's not compare apples to oranges here. And by the way, the bible also says to love thy neighbor, so maybe we should focus on that instead of cherry-picking verses to suit our agenda.",

And who said anything about the baker being ashamed? I said he might not be proud, which is a far cry from shame. But hey, why let facts get in the way of your narrative? And yes, he could ask, but why should he have to? Why should anyone have to out themselves just to buy a cake? That's the real issue here.

And yes, comparing it to a Nazi rally might be a bit strong, but the principle is the same - no one should be forced to support something they don't believe in. As for the 'harm' in baking a cake, it's the precedent it sets. Where does it stop? Can a Muslim baker be forced to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding? Can a Jewish baker be forced to bake a cake for a neo-Nazi rally? The slippery slope is real, and we should be careful not to slide down it. Let's not forget, freedom of belief is a two-way street.",

It's not like they're being asked to participate in a religious ceremony or anything. They're just being asked to bake a cake, which is a service they offer to everyone. I think the principle of freedom of belief is important, but so is the principle of equal treatment under the law. If a business is open to the public, it should be open to everyone, regardless of who they are or who they love. As for the slippery slope argument, I think it's a bit of a red herring. We're not talking about forcing anyone to do anything against their will. We're talking about a business providing a service to a customer.

However, we must also consider the baker's right to freedom of expression and conscience. A cake is not just a product, but a form of artistic expression. Forcing a baker to create something that goes against their beliefs is akin to compelling an artist to paint a mural they disagree with. The slippery slope argument may not be a red herring; it's a legitimate concern. Where do we draw the line? Can a Jewish baker be forced to bake a Nazi-themed cake? The principle of equal treatment under the law is crucial, but so is the principle of freedom of belief and expression. Let's not dismiss the baker's rights in our quest to protect the couple's. Perhaps a compromise can be found, such as the baker referring the couple to another baker who is willing to create the cake. ",
