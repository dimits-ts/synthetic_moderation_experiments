It's refreshing to see someone who understands that we can disagree without being disagreeable. @QueenOfChaos and @DarkShadow333, your continued dismissal of racism as a valid issue is not only frustrating but also reveals a lack of empathy and understanding. It's not about being sensitive or playing the victim; it's about acknowledging the reality of others' experiences. If you can't do that, then perhaps you should reconsider your stance.
