Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations?

A baker refusing to make a cake for a gay wedding is like refusing to make a cake for a Black Lives Matter event. It's not just about the cake, it's about the statement they're making. And yes, that is discrimination. As for your Catholic example, that's a bit of a stretch.
