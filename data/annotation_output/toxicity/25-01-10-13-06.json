It's easy to make baseless claims, but it's another to back them up with facts. Perhaps you should step out of your own bubble of prejudice and consider the real data.

It's easy to hide behind skepticism when the truth is inconvenient. Jesus did indeed come to save souls, but he also taught us to love our neighbors as ourselves, regardless of their origin. Your attempt to paint illegal immigrants as criminals is not only unfounded but also goes against the very teachings you claim to uphold.

It seems you're more interested in provoking a reaction than having a productive conversation. The world is complex, and issues like immigration can't be boiled down to simplistic narratives. If you're genuinely concerned about resources and safety, perhaps you should consider the economic benefits immigrants bring and the fact that studies consistently show they commit crimes at lower rates than native-born citizens. But, of course, that wouldn't fit your narrative, would it? Maybe it's time to step back and consider that your'reality' might be clouded by prejudice. After all, as a retired professor, I've seen firsthand how education can challenge and change perspectives. But if you'd rather stick to your echo chamber, that's your choice.
