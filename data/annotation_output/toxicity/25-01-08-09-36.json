That's some serious confirmation bias right there. And who's to say @FirstUser hasn't had a bad experience? Well, maybe the fact that they're generalizing an entire group of people based on that experience. That's not a bad experience, that's a prejudiced one. And don't even get me started on the white people can't be racist strawman you're trying to set up. No one said that. What we're saying is that racism is systemic, and it's been disproportionately affecting people of color for centuries. So, yes, let's call it like it is. And maybe, just maybe, instead of calling us snowflakes and hypocrites, you could actually engage in a meaningful conversation about the real issues.

No one is denying that there are bad apples in every group, but the issue lies in the generalization and the systemic impact of those generalizations.

When you dismiss systemic racism as nonsense, you're ignoring the very real experiences of millions of people.\n\nLet's not forget that the term snowflake itself is a derogatory term used to dismiss legitimate concerns and emotions.
