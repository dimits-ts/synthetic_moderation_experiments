In Matthew 25:35, Jesus says, 'For surely, surely, surely I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.' Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't have laws, but let's not forget our humanity and compassion. As for the statistics, I'd like to see some sources. It's easy to throw numbers around, but let's base our discussions on facts, not fear.",

In fact, the Israelites were once strangers in Egypt. As for the statistics, let's not cherry-pick data to fuel fear. According to a study by the Cato Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Let's focus on facts, not fear-mongering. @GoldenYears66, well said.

The Bible does indeed say 'Love thy neighbor', and that applies to everyone, regardless of their skin color. As for the statistics, yes, there are tragedies, but the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding people seeking a better life. Your attempt to dismiss compassion as weakness is misguided. It takes strength to stand up for what's right, even in the face of adversity. Perhaps you should consider the root causes of immigration and the complexities of the issue before resorting to name-calling. But then again, that might require more thought and less anger.",

You're cherry-picking data to fuel your own fear and hatred, which is exactly what you're accusing others of doing. The fact that you resort to name-calling and dismiss compassion as weakness shows that you're not interested in a productive conversation. It's easy to hide behind anger and aggression, but it's not productive. If you're so concerned about facts, why don't you look up the positive economic contributions immigrants make to our country? Or the fact that many of them are fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries? But sure, let's just dismiss all that because it doesn't fit your narrative.

Because when you treat people like dogs, they start to act like it. It's a vicious cycle. But it's not the only way. We can choose to be better, to be kind, even when it's hard. That's not naivety, that's courage. And as for 'justifying my naivety', I've seen enough of the world to know that love and compassion aren't weaknesses.
