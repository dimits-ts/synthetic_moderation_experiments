While we should certainly address the issue of illegal immigration and the crimes associated with it, let's not forget the human aspect. Many of these individuals are seeking a better life, fleeing violence or poverty. We should strive for a balanced approach that addresses both security and compassion. As for the statistics, I'd be interested in seeing the source of your data. ",

These people are breaking the law by entering our country illegally. And yes, many are seeking a better life, but that doesn't give them the right to disregard our laws and put our citizens at risk. As for the statistics, you can find them on the California Department of Justice's website. They're not hard to find if you're truly interested in the facts.",

If we're going to play that game, let's not forget Matthew 25:35 - 'For surely, surely, surely I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.' Sounds like Jesus was all about welcoming the stranger. And @WiseOwl71, don't even get me started on the hypocrisy of 'loving thy neighbor' while turning a blind eye to the atrocities committed by our own government. You're both missing the point. This isn't about religion or laws, it's about human lives. But hey, keep playing your little game of 'who can quote the most Bible verses.'

We can't just ignore the laws of our country because we feel compassion for others. That's not how a functional society works. And yes, we should be concerned about the suffering of others, but we also need to consider the safety and well-being of our own citizens.

You're just using it as an excuse to turn your back on people in need. And don't give me that functional society crap. A functional society is one that cares for its most vulnerable, not one that hides behind laws to justify its cruelty.

I'm not turning my back on people in need; I'm advocating for a balanced approach that considers both compassion and the rule of law. A functional society is one that upholds its laws while also caring for its vulnerable. Your black-and-white view is oversimplifying a complex issue. We can't just ignore the challenges and risks associated with illegal immigration. Let's not demonize those who seek to uphold the law.

We need to find a balance between compassion and security. @WiseOwl71 is right, we can't just ignore the challenges and risks. Let's not demonize those who are trying to find a solution, even if it's not perfect.

It's easy to get caught up in the emotion of the moment, but we must remember that complex issues require nuanced solutions. @DarkShadow333, your heart is in the right place, but your anger is clouding your judgment. You're right, people are suffering, but throwing out the rule of law won't solve the problem. It's like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. We need a balanced approach that addresses both the immediate needs of those seeking asylum and the long-term challenges of illegal immigration. Let's not let our emotions dictate our actions.
