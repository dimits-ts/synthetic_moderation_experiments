The baker's refusal is indeed a form of discrimination, and while it's not the same as racial discrimination, it's still harmful.

You said, That's a fair trade-off for exercising their personal beliefs in a public setting. I disagree. The baker's personal beliefs don't give them the right to discriminate against others. If they can't serve a customer without discriminating, perhaps they should reconsider their business model. After all, a business that serves everyone is a business that can grow and thrive.\n\n@TechGuru88, you're right that we need to consider the precedent, but let's not forget that the law is not a static thing.
