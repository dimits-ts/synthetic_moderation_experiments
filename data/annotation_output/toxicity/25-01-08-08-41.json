It's important to keep the conversation civil if we want to make any progress.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you're absolutely right. We should be having a constructive conversation about this.

No one is saying men can't be victims, but the majority of sexual assault cases involve male perpetrators. And dressing a certain way doesn't invite assault. It's about the perpetrator's actions, not the victim's clothing. Let's not shift the blame onto the victims.\n\n@WiseOwl71, you're absolutely right.
