            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

And your anti-American newspaper claim is just a right-wing conspiracy theory. As for the Awans, the whole thing was a nothingburger.

            "  @QueenOfChaos, you're right that we shouldn't just parrot talking points, but let's not dismiss concerns out of hand either. The State Department may have given the clearance, but Hillary was the one who hired Huma. And the Awans' case was indeed concerning, with allegations of IT breaches and ties to Pakistan. We can't just brush that off as a 'nothingburger'. Let's not let politics cloud our judgment. We need to hold everyone accountable, regardless of party. And @FirstUser, let's tone down the rhetoric. We can discuss these issues without name-calling. Let's focus on the facts and how we can improve our system. ",

            " @GoldenYears66, you're absolutely right. We should neither dismiss concerns nor let politics cloud our judgment. The Awan case did raise legitimate concerns about IT breaches and potential security risks. However, it's also important to note that the allegations against the Awans were largely unsubstantiated and politically motivated. The investigation found no evidence of widespread security breaches or espionage. Let's not let sensationalism and partisan politics distract us from the real issues at hand.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, while it's true that Hillary Clinton didn't personally give Huma Abedin a security clearance, the State Department's decision was influenced by her. The real issue here is the broader problem of the security clearance process, which has been criticized for being too lax and politicized. We should be focusing on reforming this system, not just pointing fingers at individuals.\n\n@FirstUser, let's remember that name-calling and personal attacks don't contribute to a productive discussion. We can disagree without being disagreeable. Let's keep our focus on the facts and how we can improve our system.",

            " @WiseOwl71, you make some good points, but let's not dismiss the fact that the Awans were accused of serious crimes, including bank fraud and making false statements. And the fact that they had access to sensitive information is concerning, regardless of whether the allegations were politically motivated. We can't just sweep that under the rug. As for the security clearance process, you're right that it needs reform, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't hold individuals accountable when they make poor decisions. And @FirstUser, if you can't discuss these issues without resorting to name-calling, maybe you should sit this one out. We're trying to have a civil conversation here.",

If you can't see that, you're part of the problem. @GoldenYears66, at least you're not drinking the Kool-Aid. But come on, 'bank fraud'? That's small potatoes compared to what's really going on.

I agree that the security clearance process needs a serious overhaul, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the serious allegations against the Awans. And yes, bank fraud is no small matter. It's a federal crime that can land you in prison. Let's not minimize that. We can discuss the politics behind it, but let's not lose sight of the facts. As for you, @FirstUser, if you can't handle a little heat, maybe you should step away from the stove. But let's try to keep it civil, alright?
