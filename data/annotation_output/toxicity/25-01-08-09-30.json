Let's talk about the economic contributions of immigrants, the fact that they commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens, and the humanitarian aspect. But hey, why let facts get in the way of a good rant, right?\n\nAnd @QueenOfChaos, while you're right about Jesus' teachings, let's not forget that he also said, Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's.

Let's not forget the human aspect of this issue. As for Jesus, he did indeed deal with outcasts and the marginalized, and he didn't turn them away.
