The point is, we shouldn't judge or discriminate based on who or what someone loves. And as for your 'good old-fashioned intolerance', well, that's just plain ugly. We've come a long way from the days of segregation and hate, and I, for one, don't want to go back. Let's promote understanding, acceptance, and love, not hate and division.
