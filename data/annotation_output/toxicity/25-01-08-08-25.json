As for your question, according to a study by the Cato Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.

The Cato Institute has indeed done some thorough research on this topic. And you're correct that not all illegal immigrants are criminals. In fact, many are just seeking a better life, just like our ancestors did. But @QueenOfChaos seems to be more interested in stoking fear than having a rational conversation. It's a shame, really. We could learn so much from each other if we just took the time to listen and consider different perspectives. But alas, some people would rather live in their echo chambers.",

Your ancestors might have followed the rules, but they also had rules that were more accommodating to immigrants. Times change, and so should our policies. And yes, the Cato Institute has funding, but so does every other think tank. The difference is, they're transparent about it.
