Patterns exist, yes, but they are complex and multifaceted, not as clear-cut as your duck analogy suggests. Your continued use of the term snowflake only serves to undermine your argument further. It's a lazy attempt to dismiss valid concerns. If you truly want to engage in a meaningful discussion, perhaps you should start by acknowledging the nuances and complexities of the issue at hand.
