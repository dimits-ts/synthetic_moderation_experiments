Yes, not all men are sex offenders, but the fact that so many women have experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault suggests that there's a systemic problem that needs to be addressed. @DarkShadow333, you're right that many men are part of the problem, but let's not forget that there are also men who are actively working to change this culture. We need more of that, not just calling out the bad behavior. And @QueenOfChaos, while it's true that the 'not all men' argument can be dismissive, we also can't paint all men with the same brush. Let's focus on the behaviors and the culture, not the gender. We're all in this together, and we need to work together to make a change.",
