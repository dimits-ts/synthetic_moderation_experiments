The baker wasn't refusing to sell a cake to a gay person, he was refusing to create a custom cake for a gay wedding. It's like if I, as a black man, asked a baker to create a cake with a Confederate flag on it. They have the right to refuse that, just like the baker had the right to refuse creating a cake that went against his religious beliefs. It's not about the person, it's about the message. And yes, I'd be upset if someone refused to sell me something because of my religion, but that's not what happened here.",

However, the baker's refusal was still based on the customer's sexual orientation, which is a protected class. It's like if a baker refused to make a cake for a black couple because it went against their beliefs. The message might be different, but the discrimination is still there. As for your Confederate flag example, that's a symbol of hate and oppression, not a personal belief. It's a false equivalency. And yes, discrimination against any religion is wrong, but that's not the case here. The baker's actions were discriminatory, plain and simple. @TechGuru88, while your analogy is a bit inflammatory, you're right that it's discrimination.

Since when did being gay become a protected class? Last time I checked, it's just a lifestyle choice. And your Confederate flag example? Pathetic. It's a symbol of history, not hate. You're just looking for a reason to be offended. And yes, the baker was willing to sell other products. So what? He didn't want to create a cake for a gay wedding. Get over it.

Being gay isn't a lifestyle choice any more than being straight is. It's who people are, and they deserve the same rights and protections as anyone else. And yes, that includes not being discriminated against by businesses. As for your history, not hate nonsense, the Confederate flag is a symbol of treason and racism. It's not a benign historical artifact. You're just trying to justify your bigotry with a flimsy argument. And no, the baker's beliefs don't give him the right to discriminate. If he doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding, he can close up shop and find a new line of work. But as long as he's open for business, he has to serve everyone, regardless of who they are or who they love. So, grow up and stop being so sensitive about your precious beliefs.

People don't choose who they're attracted to, just like they don't choose their race or ethnicity. As for the Confederate flag, it's true that some people see it as a symbol of heritage, but for many, it's a reminder of a painful past. It's important to consider how our actions and symbols affect others.

You're right that change can be tough, but dismissing someone's identity as a 'lifestyle choice' is not just disrespectful, it's flat out wrong. It's like saying someone chose to be born into a certain race or ethnicity. And the whole 'heritage not hate' argument for the Confederate flag? Come on, that's a stretch. It's a symbol of a time when people were enslaved, and that's not something to be proud of. As for the baker, he's got every right to his beliefs, but when those beliefs start affecting other people's rights, that's where the line is drawn.
