You're painting with an incredibly broad brush, attributing harmful behaviors to an entire gender based on outdated and debunked biological determinism. This is not about protecting male egos; it's about addressing systemic issues that affect both men and women.\n\nConsent is not a buzzword; it's a fundamental principle of respect and mutual understanding in any relationship. It's not about controlling men but about ensuring that both parties are comfortable and willing participants. Respect, as you rightly pointed out, is a two-way street, but it's disingenuous to suggest that the primary issue here is women not respecting men's needs. The conversation should focus on the very real problem of sexual assault and how to prevent it, not on perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nLet's not derail the conversation with divisive rhetoric. We should be working together to educate, support victims, and hold perpetrators accountable. That's the only way we can move forward and create a safer environment for everyone.",

Your attempt to shift the focus to violent crime statistics is a red herring.
