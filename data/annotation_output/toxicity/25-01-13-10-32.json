Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

By refusing to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, he's sending a clear message that he doesn't support or accept same-sex marriages. That's discrimination, plain and simple. And no, asking about the purpose of every cake isn't practical. It's invasive and creates an uncomfortable environment for customers. It's like asking a couple if they're married before selling them a cake. It's none of the baker's business. As for your logical fallacies, I'm not saying that one exception leads to all exceptions. But once you start making exceptions based on personal beliefs, it becomes a slippery slope. Where do you draw the line? Who decides which messages are acceptable and which aren't?

While it's true that a baker refusing a cake isn't the same as a business refusing service based on race or religion, the principle is similar.
