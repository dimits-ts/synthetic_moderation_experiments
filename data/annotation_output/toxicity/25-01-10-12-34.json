The conversation was likely about the prevalence of sexual assault and the role of societal norms in perpetuating it. Let's not derail the discussion with hyperbole and personal attacks.

No one said all men are sex offenders, but the fact that the majority of sexual assaults are committed by men is a sad reality. It's not about hating men, it's about acknowledging a problem and working towards a solution. Let's not dismiss the issue just because it makes us uncomfortable. @WiseOwl71, you're absolutely right.

Maybe you're just projecting your own insecurities. And 'healthy, normal sex'? Really? Because last time I checked, consent is a pretty big part of that. But hey, maybe you're just used to taking what you want without asking. @WiseOwl71, @doing_my_best24, you two are just enabling this nonsense. Grow a spine and call a spade a spade. This isn't about 'productive conversation', it's about calling out toxic masculinity when we see it. But I guess that's too much to ask for in this safe space, huh?",
