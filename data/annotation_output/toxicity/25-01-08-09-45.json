However, the fact remains that the majority of sexual assaults are committed by men. It's important to acknowledge that and work towards changing the culture that allows this to happen. Let's not dismiss the issue just because it makes us uncomfortable. We should be promoting healthy, consensual sex, not denying the problem.",

That's a fact, not an agenda. And yes, we should teach everyone about respect and boundaries, but that doesn't negate the need to address the specific issues that men need to learn about, like toxic masculinity and entitlement. Don't deflect and try to make this about women lying about assault. That's a tiny fraction of cases and doesn't negate the very real problem we're discussing.

It's amazing how some people can't handle facts without resorting to personal attacks. @QueenOfChaos, if you're so concerned about false accusations, why not focus on improving the justice system to better handle those cases? But no, it's easier to deflect and play the victim, isn't it? Let's not forget that the vast majority of sexual assault victims are women, and the vast majority of perpetrators are men. That's not an agenda, that's reality. And yes, we should teach everyone about consent, but let's not pretend that men don't need to unlearn some toxic behaviors.

I've seen too many men in my life who think they can do whatever they want just because they're men. That's not right, and we need to teach our boys better. But you're wrong to dismiss the need to teach men about consent and toxic masculinity. It's not about hating men, it's about making sure our sons and grandsons grow up to be better men than we were. And yes, women can lie about assault, but that's a tiny fraction of cases. Let's not let that small number distract us from the real problem.
