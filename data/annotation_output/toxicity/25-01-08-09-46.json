            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

They have a clear bias, just like any other news outlet. Let's not forget that they were sued for defamation by a company they falsely accused of being linked to terrorism. As for the Awans, the whole situation was complex and not as clear-cut as you're making it out to be. The FBI investigated and found no evidence of wrongdoing related to terrorism.
