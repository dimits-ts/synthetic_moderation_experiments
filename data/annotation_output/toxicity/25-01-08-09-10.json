That's a statistical fact, not a personal attack. We need to address the root causes of this issue, not dismiss it as a hateful generalization. Let's not derail the conversation with defensive rhetoric.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, while I agree with your point, let's try to avoid name-calling. It's not productive and can escalate the situation.

Victim-blaming is a toxic attitude that only serves to perpetuate the problem. It's not about what women wear; it's about the actions of the perpetrators. We should be teaching people not to assault, not teaching women to dress a certain way to avoid it. Your use of derogatory terms like feminazi and slut is unacceptable and does nothing to contribute to a constructive dialogue.

If you leave your car unlocked, don't be surprised if it gets stolen. Same goes for dressing like you're at a rave and then acting shocked when someone takes notice. And don't give me that teach people not to assault crap. That's like saying teach sharks not to bite. Some people are just predators, and it's naive to think otherwise.
