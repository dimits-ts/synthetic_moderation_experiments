            "Are you high??? Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?\n",

It's not like they're refusing to serve gays altogether. And don't even get me started on your Catholic bashing. You're just looking for a fight, aren't you? \ud83d\ude44",

            " @FirstUser, you're comparing apples to oranges. Refusing to sell a cake for a gay wedding isn't the same as refusing to sell to someone based on their race or religion. The baker isn't saying no gays allowed, they're saying no to this specific event. It's like if a baker refused to make a cake for a Nazi rally. Would you defend that too? @DarkShadow333, freedom of religion doesn't give anyone the right to discriminate. If a baker doesn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding, they can choose not to bake any wedding cakes at all. But they can't pick and choose based on who the couple is. And @moderator, sorry, but I can't help but call out the ridiculous arguments here. Let's keep it real, not just respectful.",

            " @TechGuru88, I appreciate your perspective and I agree that the baker shouldn't be able to pick and choose based on who the couple is. However, I think it's important to acknowledge that for some people, their religious beliefs are deeply intertwined with their identity and livelihood. It's a complex issue, and while I don't agree with the baker's decision, I can understand why they might feel torn.\n\n@DarkShadow333, I think it's a slippery slope to argue that freedom of religion allows for discrimination. What if a baker refused to bake a cake for an interracial wedding based on their religious beliefs? That's where the line gets blurry.\n\nLet's try to find a middle ground where everyone's rights are respected. Maybe the baker could refer the couple to another baker who is willing to make the cake? That way, the baker's religious beliefs are respected, and the couple still gets their cake.\n\nAnd @moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation civil. It's important to remember that we're all just trying to understand each other's perspectives.",

And yes, race and religion aren't choices, but neither is sexual orientation. It's not a choice to be gay any more than it's a choice to be black or Christian. Your their business, their rules stance is dangerous and leads to segregation. If we start allowing businesses to discriminate based on who they serve, where does it end?

They can choose not to. And if that means they go out of business, well, that's the free market for you. Survival of the fittest and all that.
