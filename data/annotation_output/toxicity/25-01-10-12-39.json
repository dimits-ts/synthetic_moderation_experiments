            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

And the 'anti-American newspaper' claim isn't just a conspiracy theory - Huma's mother is a known supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. As for the Awans, the fact that they had access to sensitive data for years without proper vetting is a massive security risk.

            " @FirstUser, your post is filled with generalizations and false claims. The fact that you're blaming liberals for all the government's problems shows a lack of critical thinking. Yes, there are issues with security clearances, but it's not a liberal vs conservative problem. It's a systemic issue that needs to be addressed by competent people, not by demonizing an entire political party.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, while you're right that Fox News often sensationalizes issues, you can't dismiss the concerns about Huma Abedin's mother's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It's a valid concern that should have been properly vetted. However, the 'anti-American newspaper' claim is indeed a conspiracy theory with no solid evidence.\n\n@TechGuru88, you're right that both sides have issues, but let's not forget that the current administration has also had its share of security clearance controversies. The point is, we need to fix the system, not just point fingers.\n\nLet's have a constructive discussion about how to improve our security clearance process, instead of just blaming each other. That's the only way we'll make progress.",
