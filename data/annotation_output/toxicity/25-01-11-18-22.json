Leviticus 19:34 says, The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. This principle of love and acceptance is echoed throughout the New Testament as well. As for your statistics, I'd be interested in seeing a credible source.

It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, regardless of their status, are just people seeking a better life. They're not criminals or threats. As for the Bible, it's clear that it advocates for compassion and hospitality towards strangers. Maybe we should focus on that message and work towards creating a system that reflects those values.

And yes, the Bible does advocate for compassion, but it also teaches us to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. We can't just throw open the borders without any controls.
