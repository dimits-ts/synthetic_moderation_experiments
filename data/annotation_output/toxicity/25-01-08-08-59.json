Who decides what's 'decent' or 'productive'? You? The government? The majority? History has shown us that the majority isn't always right. And as for 'deviant', that's a pretty loaded term. It's been used to marginalize and oppress countless groups throughout history. Let's not go down that road again.\n\nAs for 'woke', it's just a term used to dismiss anyone who cares about social justice and equality. It's a way to silence dissenting voices. But hey, if you want to live in a world where we ignore the struggles of others, that's your prerogative. Just don't be surprised when that world ignores you when you need help.\n\nLet's try to have a conversation that's more about understanding and less about name-calling, shall we? \ud83e\udd1d ",
