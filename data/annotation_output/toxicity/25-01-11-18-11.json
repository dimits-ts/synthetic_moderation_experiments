It's about the impact on the community and the message it sends. We can't afford to be naive and assume everyone has a valid reason for such actions. Sometimes, a spade is indeed a spade, and we need to call it as we see it. Let's not sugarcoat the truth to protect our sensibilities.",

Yes, the impact on the community is important, but so is justice, and that means getting all the facts straight first.
