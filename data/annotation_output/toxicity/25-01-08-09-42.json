However, the fact remains that the majority of sexual assaults are committed by men. It's important to acknowledge that and work towards changing the culture that allows this to happen.

It's not about hating men, it's about acknowledging a problem and working towards a solution. Let's not get defensive and start attacking those who are trying to raise awareness.

But let's not forget that false accusations are incredibly rare compared to the actual number of assaults. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, only 2-10% of sexual assault reports are false, while the vast majority are true. So, while false accusations are a problem, they're not the epidemic you're making them out to be.\n\nAnd yes, innocent men's lives can be ruined by false accusations, but that's not a reason to dismiss the very real problem of sexual assault. It's like saying we shouldn't worry about cancer because some people might get misdiagnosed. It's a false equivalence.\n\nAs for the'men are evil, women are perfect' narrative, that's a strawman argument. No one is saying men are evil or women are perfect. We're saying that there's a problem with sexual assault, and the majority of perpetrators are men. That's a fact, not an agenda.\n\nSo, let's not derail the conversation with whataboutism and false equivalences. Let's focus on the real issue and work together to find solutions.",

By focusing solely on false accusations, you're minimizing the experiences of countless victims. It's like saying we shouldn't worry about climate change because some scientists might be wrong. The overwhelming consensus and evidence point to a real problem that needs addressing.\n\nMoreover, your men are evil, women are perfect narrative is a classic example of a false dilemma. No one is saying that. We're saying that a significant problem exists, and we need to address it together. Your attempt to derail the conversation with whataboutism is not productive.
