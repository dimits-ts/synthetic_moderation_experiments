Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's not a political statement or a controversial cause. It's a simple request for a service that any other customer would receive without question. And your comparison to a printer refusing to print BLM flyers is flawed. That's a political statement, not a personal celebration. Let's not equate the two. As for religious freedom, sure, the baker has the right to their beliefs, but they don't have the right to discriminate based on those beliefs. That's not how freedom works.

And @TechGuru88, you're right that the baker isn't being forced to participate in anything, but they are being asked to provide a service they offer to everyone else. The message on the cake is incidental to the service provided. If they can't separate the two, perhaps they should reconsider their business model.
