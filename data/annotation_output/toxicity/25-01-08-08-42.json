You're right, not all men are sex offenders, but a lot of them are creeps who think it's okay to objectify and harass women.

While not all men are sex offenders, the fact remains that a significant number of sexual assaults are committed by men. It's not about hating men, it's about acknowledging the problem and working towards a solution. @DarkShadow333, you're absolutely right. Consent is the foundation of any healthy sexual relationship.

And @FirstUser, if you're so concerned about healthy, normal sex, maybe you should look into why so many men are struggling with intimacy and resorting to porn addiction.
