Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

Freedom of religion isn't just about what happens in a church, it's about how people live their lives every day. If a baker has deeply held religious beliefs that conflict with a same-sex wedding, they shouldn't be forced to participate. It's not about denying service because of who someone loves, it's about not forcing someone to endorse something they believe is wrong.\n\n@DarkShadow333, you're way off base with that 'bigotry' talk. Just because someone has a different belief doesn't make them a bigot. And yes, it is about the cake. It's a symbol of something that goes against their beliefs. They're not denying service to gay people, they're denying service to a specific event. There's a difference.\n\n@moderator, I agree, let's keep it respectful.

Yes, freedom of religion is important, but it doesn't give anyone the right to discriminate. If a baker has a problem with same-sex marriage, they can choose not to bake any wedding cakes at all. But once they decide to bake wedding cakes for heterosexual couples, they can't pick and choose who they serve based on their personal beliefs. That's not freedom of religion, that's discrimination. And let's not forget, these bakers are running a business, not a church. They're open to the public, and that means serving everyone, regardless of their personal beliefs.",

If a baker doesn't want to bake any wedding cakes, that's their choice. But if they're willing to bake for heterosexual weddings, why should they be forced to bake for same-sex weddings if it goes against their religious beliefs? That's not discrimination, that's respecting someone's deeply held convictions. And yes, they're running a business, but that doesn't mean they have to check their beliefs at the door.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping us on track.

The baker is not being forced to participate in a same-sex wedding; they're being asked to provide a service they offer to the public. It's like a restaurant refusing to serve someone because of their race or religion. It's not about the baker's beliefs; it's about their actions. If they choose to run a business open to the public, they should serve everyone equally. And yes, they can have beliefs, but those beliefs shouldn't dictate who they serve.
