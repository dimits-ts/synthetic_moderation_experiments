Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's a subtle but important distinction. If a customer asked for a cake with a swastika, would you force the baker to make it? Freedom of speech and religion protect the baker's right to choose what messages he promotes. As for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might misuse a law doesn't mean it's not valid. Let's not stoop to name-calling, it doesn't help the discussion. Let's try to understand each other's perspectives, shall we?",

And your slippery slope argument is indeed a logical fallacy. Just because someone might misinterpret a law doesn't invalidate the law itself. As for your assumption that the baker is asking everyone about their sexuality, that's a strawman argument. No one said that. The issue is about the message the cake conveys, as @WiseOwl71 pointed out. If the baker doesn't want to promote a message he disagrees with, that's his right. It's not about the customers' sexuality, it's about the message. And yes, if a customer asked for a cake with a swastika, the baker should have the right to refuse. Freedom of speech protects the baker's right to choose what messages he promotes, not force him to promote messages he disagrees with. Let's keep the discussion civil and stick to the facts, okay?",

If he was truly against the message, he wouldn't have made the cake for anyone, regardless of who was getting married. You're using the bible as an excuse to discriminate, and that's just plain wrong. As for your slippery slope argument, it's not a logical fallacy when it's based on precedent. If we allow this kind of discrimination, where does it stop? You're the one being rude and dramatic, not the rest of us.

The baker has stated that he doesn't discriminate against LGBTQ+ customers, and he has made cakes for them in the past. The issue here is the specific message he was asked to promote, not the customers themselves. As for your slippery slope argument, it's still a logical fallacy even if it's based on precedent.

Yes, the baker has the right to refuse service, but that doesn't make it any less hurtful or discriminatory. It's like saying, Sure, you can refuse to serve someone because of their race, but it's still racist. The baker's actions are a form of discrimination, and just because he's not shouting hate speech doesn't make it any less harmful. People have the right to be offended when they're being discriminated against. Let's not dismiss their feelings just because it makes us uncomfortable.

You can't just hide behind it's my business when your actions are causing harm. And don't even get me started on the looking for a reason to be offended line. That's a classic deflection tactic. People aren't looking for reasons to be offended, they're reacting to genuine discrimination. It's not about being offended, it's about being hurt and marginalized.

And your continued dismissal of that hurt is not only unproductive, but it's also disrespectful. You keep saying it's the baker's business, his rules, but that's a cop-out.

You keep reducing this to a legal issue, but it's so much more than that. It's about human dignity and respect.
