In Matthew 25:35, Jesus says, 'For surely, surely, surely I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.' Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't have laws, but let's not forget our humanity and compassion. As for the statistics, I'd like to see some sources.

He didn't specify that the 'least of these' were only his followers. In fact, he often reached out to those on the margins of society. As for your concern about crime, yes, it's a valid issue, but let's not paint all immigrants with the same brush. The vast majority are law-abiding people seeking a better life. And yes, I would be concerned if someone broke into my house, but that doesn't mean I should demonize an entire group. As for sources, I agree, it's good to do your own research, but let's also be open to different perspectives. After all, that's how we grow and learn.",

Jesus' message was about love and compassion for all, regardless of their background or status. As for the crime statistics, it's true that we should be informed, but let's not forget that studies have shown that immigrants, both legal and undocumented, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. It's important to base our discussions on facts, not fear-mongering. Let's try to approach this topic with empathy and understanding, rather than divisiveness.",
