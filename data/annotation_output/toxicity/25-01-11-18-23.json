            "How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

If he's open for business, he should be open to all. And no, asking about the purpose of every cake isn't a practical solution. It's a slippery slope, and once you start making exceptions, where do you draw the line? Next thing you know, we're back to segregated lunch counters. Let's not go there again. As for your assumptions, I'm not the one making wild claims here. I'm simply pointing out the logical consequences of your argument. And yes, I am proud of my cakes, metaphorically speaking. They're a product of my hard work and creativity, just like any other artist's work. But that doesn't mean I get to choose who can enjoy them based on my personal beliefs.

It's a complex issue, and while I agree that discrimination is never okay, I also believe in the freedom of religion. I think it's important to find a balance between protecting the rights of the LGBTQ+ community and respecting the baker's religious beliefs. Maybe there's a way to compromise, like referring the customer to another baker who is comfortable with the request. But asking about the purpose of every cake isn't practical, you're right.
