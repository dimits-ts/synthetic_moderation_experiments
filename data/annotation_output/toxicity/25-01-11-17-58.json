Leviticus 19:34 says, The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.

Compassion, kindness, and hospitality are not outdated concepts. As for your dismissal of the Bible, it's a significant text for many people, and it's important to engage with it respectfully.\n\nYour assertion that we can't just let anyone in is a valid concern, but it's not an either/or situation. We can have compassion and kindness while also having sensible immigration policies. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAs for your comment about gun laws, that's a separate issue that deserves its own discussion. Let's not derail this conversation with unrelated topics.\n\nLastly, your tone is quite aggressive. Let's remember to keep our discussions respectful and productive.

And yes, times have changed, but some principles remain constant. As for your dismissal of compassion and kindness, I think that's a bit shortsighted. We can have both a secure border and a compassionate immigration policy. It's not an either/or situation. And yes, gun laws are a separate issue, but they're not unrelated.

I agree that we can have both a secure border and a compassionate immigration policy. It's all about finding the right balance. As for gun laws, you're right that they're not unrelated. Both issues stem from a desire to keep our communities safe. Let's not forget that the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding people seeking a better life. They're not the enemy, and we shouldn't treat them as such. @DarkShadow333, your dismissal of compassion and kindness is disappointing.
