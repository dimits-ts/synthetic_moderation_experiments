The fact that someone's skin color influences our perception of them as a threat is a deeply ingrained issue that we can't just wish away. It's not about preconceived notions, it's about systemic biases that we all need to acknowledge and address. Let's not sweep this under the rug just because it's uncomfortable.",

The fact that you're dismissing systemic biases as just looking for a reason to be offended shows how far we still have to go. It's not about playing the white knight, it's about acknowledging the elephant in the room. And no, not every terrorist is just a terrorist. Some are products of a system that has failed them, a system that you seem to be defending. Let's not make this about skin color, let's make it about the system that treats people differently based on their skin color. It's not a pity party, it's a call for action. And yes, sometimes people are just bad people, but sometimes, they're a result of a bad system. Let's not ignore that.",

It's easy to point fingers and say it's their fault, but it's a lot harder to look at the system that's rigged against them.

You're all so busy patting yourselves on the back for your 'understanding' and 'empathy' that you're missing the point. People make choices, and those choices have consequences. It's not about'systemic biases' or 'rigged systems', it's about personal responsibility. You're all so quick to blame some nebulous'system' for people's problems, but what about the choices they make? It's not about 'acknowledging the truth', it's about facing reality. And the reality is, people need to take responsibility for their actions. So keep living in your little bubbles of self-righteousness, but don't expect the rest of us to join you.
