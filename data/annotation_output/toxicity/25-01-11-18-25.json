            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            " @GoldenYears66, while it's true that there have been concerns about security clearances in the past, it's important not to paint all government employees with such a broad brush. Many dedicated professionals work tirelessly to protect our nation's security. Let's not forget, the Awan family was investigated and no charges were brought against them. Also, the Muslim Brotherhood is not a terrorist organization in many countries. Let's discuss this with more nuance and less generalization.",

Sure, there have been some questionable security clearances in the past, but to say that 90% of government employees are lazy and incompetent is a bit of a stretch. Many of us work hard to keep this country safe and secure. As for the Awan family, they were investigated and no charges were brought against them. Let's not jump to conclusions based on unfounded allegations. And the Muslim Brotherhood isn't a terrorist organization in many countries, so let's not oversimplify complex geopolitical issues.",

And yes, the Awan family was investigated, but that doesn't mean they were innocent. The fact that they were even given clearances in the first place is a joke. As for the Muslim Brotherhood, they may not be designated as a terrorist group in some countries, but that doesn't change the fact that they're a radical Islamist organization. You're both just trying to defend the indefensible. Our government is a mess, and it's time we admit that.",

It's because of people like you who can't see past their own biases and conspiracy theories. The Awan family was investigated and cleared, but sure, let's keep throwing around unfounded accusations. And the Muslim Brotherhood? They're a political party in Egypt, for crying out loud. But hey, why let facts get in the way of a good old-fashioned witch hunt? @WiseOwl71 and @TechGuru88 are right, let's discuss this with some actual nuance and intelligence.

As for the Muslim Brotherhood, they're more than just a political party. They've got a long history of extremism. But sure, keep ignoring the facts because they don't fit your narrative.

They were investigated and cleared, but sure, let's keep pretending they're some kind of spy ring. You're the one who's biased, honey. You can't see past your own nose, let alone the facts.

Yes, the government has its issues, and yes, there are valid concerns about certain individuals and organizations. But let's not throw around accusations without solid evidence. The Awan family case is complex, and while it's fair to question how they got clearances, let's not jump to conclusions until we have all the facts. As for the Muslim Brotherhood, their history is indeed complicated, with both political and extremist elements. Instead of name-calling and dismissing each other's views, let's try to have a more nuanced discussion. We all want a better government, so let's focus on that goal together.",

And don't even get me started on her defense of the Muslim Brotherhood. She's either willfully ignorant or just plain naive. But hey, let's not let her ruin our conversation.

I agree that we need to look at the full picture, but sometimes it feels like some folks are just trying to sweep the ugly parts under the rug. I appreciate your level-headed approach, but I've seen too many people try to downplay the Muslim Brotherhood's extremist ties just because they're involved in politics.

It's true that these issues are complex, and we shouldn't dismiss any aspect of them. However, I think it's also important to acknowledge the power dynamics at play. When we talk about the Muslim Brotherhood or the Awan family, we're often talking about marginalized communities. So, while we're pushing for transparency, let's also be mindful of the potential for these discussions to fuel Islamophobia or xenophobia. We should strive to be critical without being prejudiced. Let's keep the conversation respectful and considerate of all perspectives.",
