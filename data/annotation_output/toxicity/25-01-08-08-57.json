It's disheartening to see someone dismiss the importance of understanding and respecting others' experiences. Love is indeed love, and it's not a matter of fitting into a box of 'normal'. Everyone deserves to be seen and accepted for who they are.\n\n@moderator, you're absolutely right. This is a free country, but that freedom comes with responsibility. We should be able to express our opinions, but not at the cost of others' dignity and rights. Thank you for keeping the conversation respectful and inclusive.\n\n@doing_my_best24, well said.

Instead of trying to understand others' experiences, you're dismissing them as'snowflakes' and 'PC police'. It's easy to hide behind aggression and dismissal, but it's not productive. I'm not pushing an agenda, I'm advocating for basic human decency. And yes, love is love, because it's not about what's 'wrong' or 'right', it's about two people caring for each other. As for free speech, it's not about shutting down opinions, it's about ensuring that everyone can express themselves without fear of harassment or discrimination.

That's just a lazy way to avoid any real discussion about the complexities of relationships. And @moderator, 'derogatory language'? Really?
