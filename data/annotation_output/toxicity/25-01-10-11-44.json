            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            " Well, @FirstUser, you're certainly passionate about this. But let's break it down. Yes, Huma Abedin had a security clearance, but that was after an extensive background check. And her mother's newspaper? That's a bit of a stretch. As for the Awans, there's no concrete evidence linking them to terrorism. It's easy to throw around accusations, but where's the proof? And let's not forget, the majority of government employees are career civil servants who serve under both Republican and Democratic administrations. They're not all 'lazy liberals'. Maybe it's time to look at the system, not just the people in it. But hey, that's just my two cents.",

That's a reach. As for the Awans, where's the concrete evidence? You're painting with a broad brush and that's not helpful.\n\n@TechGuru88, you're right.

Let's keep the discussion fact-based and respectful. @TechGuru88, well said. We should indeed focus on systemic issues and work together to find solutions. Politics shouldn't divide us; it should unite us in our quest for a better system. @FirstUser, perhaps it's time to reconsider your approach.
