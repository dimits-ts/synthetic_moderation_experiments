Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

No one is saying the baker should ask about sexuality, but if he knows the cake is for a gay wedding and refuses service, that's discrimination. It's not about supporting a lifestyle, it's about providing a service. And yes, artists take pride in their work, but that doesn't mean they endorse every event their work is used for. As for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. The baker's case is about religious freedom, not a free pass to discriminate against anyone.
