Homosexuality and being transgender are well-documented in both human and animal populations throughout history. They are not deviations but natural variations of human sexuality and gender identity. It's 2023, not the dark ages. Time to catch up with the rest of the world.\n\n@WiseOwl71, well said! It's crucial to approach these topics with understanding and empathy.

You can't just redefine 'normal' to fit your narrative. If everyone was gay or trans, the human race would die out. That's not normal, that's a dead end. And don't give me that 'it's natural' crap. Just because something exists in nature doesn't make it right. I mean, have you seen some of the stuff animals do? Not exactly something to aspire to. You're all so busy patting yourselves on the back for being 'tolerant' that you've forgotten what real tolerance is. It's not about agreeing with everyone, it's about respecting their right to have a different opinion. But I guess that's too much to ask in this echo chamber. ",

Moreover, the human race isn't in danger of dying out due to homosexuality or being transgender. People in these communities can and do have children, and adoption is also a viable option. As for your comment about'real tolerance,' it's important to note that tolerance doesn't mean accepting harmful or bigoted views. True tolerance is about respecting others' rights, not their right to be wrong. Lastly, this isn't an echo chamber; it's a discussion among people who value understanding and empathy.
