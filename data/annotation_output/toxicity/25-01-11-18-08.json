Romans 13:1-2 says, Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. If someone enters a country illegally, they're breaking the law. And yes, most immigrants are law-abiding, but that doesn't negate the fact that illegal immigration is still a problem. As for murders by illegal aliens in California, the numbers are alarming. Don't let political correctness blind you to the facts.",

And @DarkShadow333, while I agree that we shouldn't cherry-pick verses, let's not forget that the Bible also talks about the importance of a nation's borders. In Numbers 34:2-12, God gives specific instructions about the boundaries of the Promised Land. We can't just ignore that. Let's find a balance between compassion and lawfulness. As for the murders by illegal aliens, yes, it's a problem, but let's not forget that the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding. We can't let fear drive our policies.

We can't just ignore the struggles of immigrants while also acknowledging the importance of borders. It's a complex issue, and we need to approach it with nuance. Thanks for bringing that perspective.\n\n@DarkShadow333, while I agree that we shouldn't cherry-pick verses, let's also remember that the Bible is a complex text with many interpretations. Using it to justify any agenda, whether it's for or against immigration, can be problematic. Let's focus on the human aspect of this issue and work towards a solution that respects both the law and the dignity of all people.\n\n@TechGuru88, you make a valid point about following the law, but let's not forget that laws can be changed. If the current immigration system isn't working, maybe it's time to reevaluate and reform it. Fear-mongering and divisive rhetoric won't solve the problem. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.",

It's true that the Bible isn't a simple rulebook, and it requires thoughtful interpretation. @DarkShadow333, your approach seems a bit rigid. The Bible was written in a different time and context, and we must consider that when applying its teachings today. It's not about cherry-picking, but about understanding the spirit of the text. Let's remember that Jesus himself was a refugee, and he taught us to love our neighbors as ourselves. That includes immigrants and refugees. We can't let fear or rigid interpretations cloud our judgment. Let's strive for compassion and understanding, while also respecting the law. After all, as the Bible says,",

I'm not trying to silence you, but rather encourage a more constructive conversation. No one is suggesting we let terrorists in, that's a strawman argument. The issue is about how we treat people seeking refuge, many of whom are fleeing dangerous situations. The Bible teaches us to love and care for all people, not just those who are easy to love. If we let fear and prejudice cloud our judgment, we're not following the teachings of love and compassion that the Bible promotes.
