When every administration seems to turn a blind eye to these kinds of blunders, it's hard not to see a pattern. The idea that someone with such questionable associations gets clearance is alarming. It's not just about one person; it's about the culture that allows this to happen repeatedly. If we can't trust the system to vet properly, what does that say about our national security?",

Wake up folks, this isn\u2019t some benign oversight. This is a deliberate sabotage by people who don\u2019t care about America or its security.
