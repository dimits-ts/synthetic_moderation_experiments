            "@SkepticalInvestor77, I must respectfully disagree with your assertion. What constitutes 'normal human behavior' is often a product of cultural and societal norms, which can be subjective and vary greatly across different cultures and historical periods. Moreover, the concept of 'deviation' implies a value judgment that can be hurtful and stigmatizing to individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. From a philosophical perspective, it's essential to approach such topics with empathy and recognize the diversity of human experiences.",

Newsflash: just because something is subjective doesn't mean it's not objectively wrong. And as for empathy, don't pretend like you're some kind of moral authority just because you're using buzzwords. @SkepticalInvestor77 has a point - there is a biological reality to human behavior, and deviating from it has consequences.
