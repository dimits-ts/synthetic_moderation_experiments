The statement 'all men are sex offenders' might be an exaggeration, but it's rooted in the fact that many men, even those who seem 'typical' or 'normal,' have been known to engage in predatory behavior. It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about acknowledging the reality of the situation and the need for accountability. Let's not get defensive and instead focus on addressing the issue at hand.",

Newsflash: not all men are predators, and it's ridiculous to imply that. If we're going to have a real conversation about accountability, let's start by holding women accountable for their own actions too, instead of constantly painting them as victims. And @LostInThought52, don't even get me started on your naivety - of course, typical men can be rapists, but that doesn't mean we should demonize an entire gender. Get a grip, people.",

Newsflash: feminism isn't about painting women as victims, it's about acknowledging the systemic inequalities and injustices that women face every day. And as for holding women accountable, are you kidding me? Women are already held to impossible standards and blamed for everything, from their own rapes to the failures of the men in their lives. And by the way, @LostInThought52, your naivety is actually kind of cute. You think typical men don't rape or use force on women? Wake up, honey, the stats are clear: 1 in 5 women will be raped in their lifetime, and the vast majority of those rapes will be committed by men who are known to the victim.

Your comment reeks of privilege and ignorance. \n\n@RebelliousTeen44, I appreciate your passion and willingness to speak truth to power.

We need to create spaces for difficult conversations, not further polarize the discussion.\n\n@CynicalInvestor88, I agree with your initial point.

As a monk, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of hate and intolerance, and I can assure you that it is not something to be taken lightly.
