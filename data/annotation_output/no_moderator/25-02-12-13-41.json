            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            "@HumbleFarmer12, you're painting with a broad brush there. Not all liberals are incompetent or lazy. Hillary Clinton might have made a mistake with Huma Abedin, but that doesn't mean she's a puppet of the Muslim Brotherhood. And the Awans? They were hired by Democrats, sure, but they also worked for Republicans. Let's not forget that. Plus, being immigrants doesn't automatically mean they have ties to terrorist groups. That's just profiling. And what's wrong with unions? They protect workers' rights. You're just mad because you think they make it harder to fire people. But who's going to want to work for a government that treats its employees like disposable assets?",

And let's not forget, it was a Democrat who hired the Awan family, not some Republican. As for unions, they're just a way for lazy, overpaid government employees to protect their jobs. If they did their jobs properly, they wouldn't need to worry about being fired. And profiling isn't always bad. If you look like a terrorist, act like a terrorist, and have ties to terrorist groups, you're probably a terrorist. It's not rocket science.",

We're all here to discuss, not just lob grenades at each other.\n\n@HumbleFarmer12, you're right, there are concerns with the security clearances given to Huma and the Awan family. But let's not act like this is a liberal conspiracy. Republicans have had their fair share of security blunders too. Remember Snowden?\n\n@FitnessJunkie07, you're spot on about not painting all liberals with the same brush. But let's not ignore the elephant in the room. There's a reason why government employees lean Democrat. It's not just about being lazy or incompetent. It's about policy and representation.\n\n@SkepticalInvestor77, data can be interpreted in many ways. Just because 80% of government employees vote Democrat doesn't mean they're all incompetent. And profiling? Sure, it can be useful, but it can also lead to a lot of false positives. We need to strike a balance.\n\nNow, let's keep the conversation going, but let's do it with a bit more nuance and a bit less heat. We're all here to learn and grow, right? Let's not forget that.",

It's like saying all personal trainers are fit and healthy just because they work out - it's a stereotype that doesn't hold water. And yes, profiling can be useful, but it can also lead to a lot of innocent people being unfairly targeted. We need to be smart about it, not just resort to knee-jerk reactions. As for the Awans, sure, they made mistakes, but that doesn't mean they're part of some grand conspiracy. Let's not forget, they were hired by both Democrats and Republicans. It's not a liberal or conservative issue, it's a security issue. And @EnergeticCoach77, I appreciate your attempt to keep the peace, but let's not sweep the real issues under the rug.

Not all government employees are incompetent or lazy, just like not all carpenters are skilled craftsmen. It's about the individual, not the group they belong to. And profiling, well, it's a double-edged sword. It can help, but it can also lead to innocent folks being singled out. We need to use it wisely, not as a crutch for our biases.\n\nAs for the Awans, sure, they made mistakes, but let's not make mountains out of molehills. They were hired by both parties, so it's not a Democrat or Republican issue. It's about security, plain and simple. We should be more concerned with fixing the system that allowed it to happen, rather than pointing fingers at one side or the other.\n\nAnd @FitnessJunkie07, I appreciate your nuanced take on things. It's refreshing to see someone willing to look beyond the surface. Let's keep this conversation going, but let's try to leave the inflammatory rhetoric at the door.

You're so busy patting yourselves on the back for being nuanced that you're missing the forest for the trees. The Awans were hired by Democrats, not Republicans. They were given top secret clearances by Hillary Clinton herself. And you're telling me that's not a liberal conspiracy? Wake up, sheeple! It's all connected, from the Clintons to Obama to Biden. They're all in on it. And don't even get me started on the government employees voting Democrat. It's not about policy or representation, it's about control. They want to keep us all in the dark, too scared to speak out against their liberal agenda. But I won't be silenced! I see the truth, and it's staring you all in the face.
