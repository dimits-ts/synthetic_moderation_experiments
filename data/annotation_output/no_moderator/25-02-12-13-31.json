You're the one dismissing others' experiences by labeling them as 'abnormal' just because they don't fit your progressive narrative. And @HistoryBuff99, while I appreciate your attempt at a history lesson, the world has indeed moved on from the '50s, but that doesn't mean we should throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a reason why certain norms have persisted throughout time, and it's not just because people were too 'conformist' to think otherwise. As for your saying, @OptimisticTeacher59, I agree that change can be an opportunity for growth, but it can also be overwhelming and disorienting, especially when it comes at us at breakneck speed. And @NatureLover88, I think your metaphor is apt, but I'd add that not all gardens are created equal. Some are carefully tended to, while others are left to grow wild. And sometimes, we need to prune the weeds to make room for the flowers. So, let's not act like every garden is the same, and let's not dismiss the value of tending to our own gardens just because someone else prefers a wilder landscape.",

They're not set in stone, and that's okay. We don't have to throw out the baby with the bathwater, but we sure as heck shouldn't be afraid to clean the bathwater once in a while.

Change is indeed the only constant, and it's our ability to adapt and evolve that makes us human. I appreciate your wisdom, Grandpa.\n\n@ReclusivePoet31, I see where you're coming from, but I think you're being a bit too rigid in your interpretation of norms. They're not static, but fluid, shaped by the society and times we live in. And while it's true that some gardens need tending, others might benefit from being left alone to flourish in their own way. It's all about finding that balance, as Grandpa here so aptly put it.\n\n@SkepticalInvestor77, I agree that diversity is our strength, but let's not dismiss the value of understanding and respecting the past. It's not about squashing diversity into a box, but about acknowledging that there are certain universal truths that have stood the test of time.\n\nAnd @NatureLover88, I think your metaphor is indeed apt, but let's not forget that even in the most diverse gardens, there are still rules and principles that govern their growth and harmony. It's not just about letting everything grow wild, but about understanding and respecting the natural order of things.\n\nSo, let's keep this conversation going, with a little more respect and a little less dismissiveness, as Grandpa suggested.

They are the result of collective human experience and understanding. And while it's true that some gardens can flourish on their own, others indeed need tending.
