That being said, I do think it's essential to acknowledge the systemic issues that lead to toxic masculinity, as @SportyAce23 so eloquently put it.

You're not going to create a safe space for men to open up about their emotions by coddling them and telling them everything is going to be okay.

I've spent years studying the system, and I know exactly how it operates. You can't fix a fundamentally broken machine by slapping on a few feel-good band-aids. Empathy and compassion are just tools the system uses to keep people in line, to make them think they have a stake in the game. Newsflash: they don't.\n\nAnd as for my proposed solution, I'll tell you what it's not: it's not some watered-down, compromised, let's all just get along nonsense. It's not about creating a safe space for people to express their feelings or holding hands and singing Kumbaya. It's about ripping the system apart, exposing its rotten core, and rebuilding from the ashes. It's about recognizing that the system is designed to oppress, and that the only way to change it is to dismantle it entirely.\n\nYou want to know my solution? It's revolution. It's chaos. It's the complete and utter destruction of the status quo. And if you're not willing to get on board with that, then you're just part of the problem.\n\n@SkepticalInvestor77, thanks for the support, but let's not get too cozy here.
