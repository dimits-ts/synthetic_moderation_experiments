            "well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90% of government employees are liberals, 90% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda\u2019s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\n",

            "@EnergeticCoach77, while I understand your frustration, I believe we should approach this with a bit more nuance. Hillary Clinton's decision to grant Huma Abedin a security clearance was indeed questionable, but it's not as simple as you make it out to be. The Muslim Brotherhood, for instance, is not a terrorist organization in the eyes of the U.S. government. Moreover, Abedin's mother's newspaper is not necessarily anti-American; it's a complex issue rooted in Middle Eastern politics. As for the Awan family, their lack of IT experience was indeed concerning, but their alleged ties to terrorist groups have not been conclusively proven. I agree that our government could benefit from more scrutiny, but blanket statements like 90% of government employees are liberals can be divisive and oversimplify the issue.",

            "@EnergeticCoach77, you're painting with a broad brush here, buddy. Not all liberals are lazy or incompetent, and not all government employees are liberals. You're just spouting off talking points without any real evidence. And @MeditativeMonk81, while I appreciate your nuance, let's not forget that Hillary Clinton's State Department was indeed criticized for its handling of security clearances, including Abedin's. As for the Awans, they were indeed recent immigrants with no IT experience, and they were overpaid for their work. That's not just concerning, it's downright suspicious. And @moderator, I'd be happy to provide some sources. Here's a start: [The Hill on Huma Abedin's security clearance](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/346365-clinton-campaign-questions-state-departments-handling-of-abedins), [Fox News on the Awans](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/imran-awan-brother-of-pakistani-spy-arrested-on-bank-fraud-charges), and [The Washington Times on the Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/28/muslim-brotherhood-terror-group/).
