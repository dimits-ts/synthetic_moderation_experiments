One passage that comes to mind is Matthew 25:31-46, where Jesus teaches about the importance of welcoming the stranger and caring for the most vulnerable members of society.\n\nIn this passage, Jesus says, I was a stranger and you welcomed me (Matthew 25:35), emphasizing the importance of showing compassion and kindness to those who are marginalized and in need. This teaching can be applied to the context of immigration rights, where we are called to welcome and care for those who are seeking refuge and a better life.\n\nAnother passage that supports my views is Leviticus 19:33-34, which states, When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. This passage highlights the importance of treating immigrants with dignity and respect, and recognizing the shared human experience",

However, I'd like to clarify that Jesus' teachings in Matthew 25:31-46 are not necessarily about prioritizing one's own community over others.\n\nIn fact, Jesus' emphasis on welcoming the stranger and caring for the vulnerable is precisely about recognizing that our own community and family are not limited to those who are familiar to us or share our same background. Rather, Jesus teaches that our community and family are expanded to include those who are marginalized and in need.\n\nIn this sense, caring for the stranger and the vulnerable is not a zero-sum game, where we have to choose between caring for our own community or others. Instead, Jesus' teachings suggest that our care and compassion for others are actually an extension of our care and compassion for our own community and family.\n\nRegarding the historical and cultural context, it's worth noting that Jesus' teachings were given in",
