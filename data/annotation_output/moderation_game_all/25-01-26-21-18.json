Don't get me wrong, I'm all for respectful conversations and exchanging ideas, but let's not forget that we're all here to challenge each other's perspectives and grow from the experience. Empathy and respect are great, but they shouldn't come at the cost of critical thinking and debate.\n\nI think we can create a culture of empathy and respect by acknowledging that we're all flawed and that our perspectives are limited.
