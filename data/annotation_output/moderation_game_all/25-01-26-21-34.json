By focusing on education, empathy, and open communication, we can work towards creating a safer and more inclusive environment for everyone. @TechGuru88, I understand that your initial response may have been driven by a desire to defend a particular group, but I encourage you to consider the importance of listening to and amplifying the voices of those who have been affected by sexual assault and harassment.
