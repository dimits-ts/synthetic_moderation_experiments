It's essential to acknowledge that not all men are sex offenders, and it's crucial to differentiate between typical men and those who commit heinous crimes.\n\nHowever, we must also recognize that there are men who do commit sex offenses, and it's vital to address the issue of consent and healthy relationships. Rather than dismissing the conversation as hating men or being against healthy sex, let's focus on promoting respectful dialogue and education about boundaries and mutual respect.\n\nBy doing so, we can work together to create a safer and more empathetic environment for everyone.
