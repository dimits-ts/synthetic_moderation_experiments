There's a fine line here.\n\nCreativeChef99: @SomeUser1 Freedom of expression does not give you the right to discriminate against someone based on who they love or their beliefs. That\u2019s not expression; that\u2019s prejudice wrapped up in pretty words.\n\n@SomeUser2: It's a complex issue, but businesses should serve all customers regardless of their identity. Refusal to serve based on discrimination sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nCreativeChef99: @SomeUser2 Exactly! We need to stand firm on equality and inclusivity. No exceptions.",
