And let's not forget about the Awan brothers, hired by Democrats and Republicans alike, but with clear ties to Pakistan and no IT experience. It's not just a systemic issue, it's a liberal issue. They're the ones in charge, and they're the ones making these poor decisions. And yes, the 90% figure might be a myth, but it's not far off.
