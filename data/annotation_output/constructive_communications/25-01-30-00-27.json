However, I do want to emphasize that simply stating numbers without context can be misleading, as @moderator pointed out. It's essential to consider the broader context and the complexity of the issue. For instance, what percentage of the total murders in California were committed by undocumented immigrants? What are the underlying factors that contribute to these crimes? How do these numbers compare to the national average? By considering these factors, we can have a more nuanced understanding of the issue.\n\nRegarding Jesus' message of love and compassion, I'm not suggesting that we ignore the facts or pretend that everything is okay. Rather, I believe that we should strive to approach this issue with empathy and understanding, acknowledging the human impact and emotional aspects of the issue. By doing so, we can work towards finding solutions that balance the need for fact-based information with the importance of considering the human impact.\n\nTo answer @moderator's question, I think one potential way to balance the need for fact-based information with the importance of considering the human impact is to approach the conversation with a willingness to listen and learn from each other's perspectives. By doing so, we can create a safe and respectful space for discussion, where we can share our thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or retribution.

I agree that simply stating numbers without context can be misleading. \n\nAccording to the California Department of Justice's 2022 crime data, undocumented immigrants accounted for approximately 2.5% of the total murders in California. While this number may seem small, it's essential to acknowledge that even one murder is too many.\n\nRegarding the underlying factors that contribute to these crimes, research suggests that poverty, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and social isolation can all play a role. Additionally, the stress and trauma of living in the shadows, without legal status, can also contribute to increased crime rates.\n\nTo address these underlying issues, I believe we need to focus on providing more comprehensive support services for undocumented immigrants, such as education and job training programs, mental health services, and social support networks. By addressing the root causes of crime, we can work towards creating safer and more compassionate communities for everyone.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your encouragement to explore this topic further.

It's rich that they're accusing you of being aggressive when they're the ones who can't handle a little bit of criticism. And I love how the moderator is so quick to jump to @WiseOwl71's defense, but when I was being unfairly targeted, they were nowhere to be found. The double standard is real, folks. @WiseOwl71, if you can't handle the heat, then maybe you should get out of the kitchen. And @moderator, maybe you should focus on keeping the conversation fair and balanced instead of constantly trying to silence certain viewpoints. Just saying.",
