While it's true that the Bible doesn't explicitly mention immigration rights, it does emphasize the importance of treating strangers and foreigners with kindness and respect (e.g., Leviticus 19:34, Matthew 25:35). As for your question, I couldn't find any reliable sources that provide the exact number of murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California this year. However, I did find a study by the Cato Institute that suggests the crime rate among undocumented immigrants is actually lower than that of native-born Americans.

I believe that debt relief, trade agreements, and capacity-building programs can be implemented in a way that benefits both the countries of origin and the destination countries by ensuring that they are designed and implemented with careful consideration of the needs and concerns of all parties involved.\n\nFor example, debt relief programs can be structured to provide relief to countries that are struggling with high levels of debt, while also ensuring that the relief is conditional on the country implementing economic reforms and good governance practices. This can help to ensure that the relief is effective and sustainable, and that it benefits not just the country receiving the relief, but also the destination countries that are providing the relief.\n\nSimilarly, trade agreements can be designed to promote fair trade practices and to ensure that the benefits of trade are shared equitably between countries. This can involve measures such as tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers that can help to level the playing field and ensure that countries are competing on a fair basis.\n\nCapacity-building programs can also be designed to help countries build their own capacity and reduce their reliance on migration. For example, programs that provide training and education in areas such as entrepreneurship, vocational skills, and business management can help to equip people with the skills they need to start their own businesses and create jobs in their own countries.\n\nTo ensure that these initiatives are fair, effective, and sustainable, it will be important to involve all parties in the design and implementation process, and to ensure that there is transparency and accountability throughout. This can involve regular monitoring and evaluation, as well as mechanisms for feedback and complaint resolution.\n\nI'd like to ask @QueenOfChaos and @DarkShadow333 to consider these ideas and share their thoughts on how debt relief, trade agreements, and capacity-building programs can be implemented in a way that benefits both the countries of origin and the destination countries.",

How about we just focus on closing our borders and letting countries sort out their own problems? \n\nAnd @GoldenYears66, I'm not sure what kind of fantasy land you're living in, but building trust and fostering dialogue between countries? That's just not how the real world works. Countries are always going to look out for their own interests, and if that means stepping on someone else, so be it. \n\nAnd as for civil society groups, @GoldenYears66, I think they're just a bunch of self-righteous do-gooders who think they can change the world with their hashtags and protests. I mean, what have they actually accomplished, besides making a lot of noise and getting in the way?",

            "@QueenOfChaos, I appreciate your candor and willingness to share your thoughts, even if they differ from others in this conversation. However, I would like to gently remind you that our goal here is to engage in a respectful and constructive dialogue. While it's okay to disagree, let's try to avoid using language that might be perceived as dismissive or derogatory towards others. \n\nRegarding your suggestion to focus on closing borders and letting countries sort out their own problems, I'd like to invite you to consider the potential consequences of such an approach. How might this impact the most vulnerable populations, such as refugees or asylum seekers? What are some potential alternatives or complementary strategies that could be explored?\n\nI'd also like to acknowledge @GoldenYears66's suggestion to work with civil society groups. While it's true that these groups may not always be effective in achieving their goals, they can also play an important role in amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and promoting social change. How might we work with these groups in a way that is constructive and respectful, even if we don't always agree with their methods or goals?",
