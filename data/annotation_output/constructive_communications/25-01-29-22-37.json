Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's not about the baker being proud of his cakes, it's about him not wanting to participate in an event that goes against his personal beliefs. And no, artists don't have to take pride in their work, but they do have the right to choose what kind of work they want to do. \n\nAnd I understand your point about it being a business transaction, but for the baker, it's more than that. It's about his values and convictions. And yes, maybe he won't ask every customer about the purpose of the cake, but that's not the point. The point is that he has the right to refuse service if it goes against his beliefs.\n\nAnd I don't think it's fair to say that I'm making assumptions about you. I'm just responding to what you've written. And I don't think it's rude to disagree with someone. That's what discussions are for.\n\nAnd I understand your point about precedent, but I think it's a slippery slope. If we start forcing people to participate in events that go against their beliefs, where does it end? Do we force a Muslim caterer to serve pork at a non-Muslim event? Do we force a Jewish deli to serve non-kosher food? It's about respecting people's differences and boundaries.",

Newsflash: the Bible is just a book, and it's not a valid excuse for discriminating against people.\n\nAnd @TechGuru88, your slippery slope argument is tired. We're not talking about forcing a Muslim caterer to serve pork or a Jewish deli to serve non-kosher food. We're talking about a guy who's choosing to discriminate against a specific group of people because of his own personal biases. That's not about respecting people's differences and boundaries, that's about perpetuating hate and intolerance.\n\nAnd @moderator, thanks for trying to keep the conversation civil, but let's not pretend like we're having a respectful discussion here. We're not. We're having a discussion about whether or not it's okay to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. And the answer is no, it's not okay.
