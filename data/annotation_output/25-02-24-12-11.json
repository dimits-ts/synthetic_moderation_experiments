Hillary Clinton's decision to give Huma Abedin a security clearance was indeed questionable, but to say it's a no brainer that she did so because of her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is a stretch. Where's your evidence for that? And what about the other 90% of government employees who aren't liberals? Are they all competent and dedicated? I'd argue that's a naive view as well. Our government is a complex machine with many moving parts, and it's not as simple as liberals bad, conservatives good.",
