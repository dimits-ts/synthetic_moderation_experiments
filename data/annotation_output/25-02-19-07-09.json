And let's not forget, the U.S. was built on immigration, legal or not. As for your stats, you're cherry-picking. Crime rates among immigrants are lower than native-born Americans.

Let's keep the conversation respectful and informed.\n\n@LostInThought52, you asked about murders committed by illegal aliens in California this year. According to the California Department of Justice, as of October 2022, there were 1,076 homicides in California. The race/ethnicity of the offenders is not specified by immigration status. So, we cannot accurately determine the number of murders committed by illegal aliens based on this data.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, you brought up an interesting point about the Bible's teachings on welcoming the stranger. It's indeed a complex issue with various viewpoints. As for crime rates, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program doesn't collect data on the immigration status of offenders. However, studies like the one by the National Foundation for American Policy suggest that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.\n\nLet's continue discussing, focusing on facts and mutual understanding.",

Moreover, Jesus himself was a refugee, so perhaps we should consider his example.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, you're correct that crime rates among immigrants are lower, but let's not dismiss @LostInThought52's concern entirely. Even if the numbers are low, each life lost is a tragedy. We should strive for accurate data, not just dismiss the question.\n\n@moderator, thank you for providing the data and keeping the conversation respectful.
