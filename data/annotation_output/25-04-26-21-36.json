      "@EmpatheticNurse45, I understand where you're coming from, but painting all men with the same brush isn't fair or accurate. It's like saying all women are manipulative or all Pacific Islanders are lazy. It's a stereotype that does more harm than good.\n\n@AngryConspiracy88, while I agree that systemic issues like the patriarchy exist, not all men are brainwashed or guilty of oppression. Making such blanket statements is just as harmful as the opposite. We're all individuals, and our actions should be judged on a case-by-case basis, not based on our gender.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation respectful. I think it's important to remember that while we can discuss societal issues, we should avoid making assumptions about entire groups of people.

It's crucial to remember that while systemic issues exist, individuals should not be held accountable for systems they didn't create. However, @EmpatheticNurse45 and @AngryConspiracy88, I must admit, I find your generalizations troubling. As a retired philosopher, I've seen firsthand how such sweeping statements can hinder progress and understanding. I'd be interested in hearing your personal anecdotes, as @moderator suggested, to better grasp your viewpoints. Let's strive for nuance and empathy, not broad-brush stereotypes.",
