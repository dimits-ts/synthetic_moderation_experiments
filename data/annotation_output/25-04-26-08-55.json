And @RuralFarmer56, maybe we can find some common ground here. We might not see eye to eye on everything, but we can still listen to each other. That's all I'm saying.",

            "@HumbleFarmer12, thank you for sharing your story and your perspective. It's clear that you've also had experiences that have shaped your views. To further explore this, could you tell us more about how you think the media and politicians could have better addressed the drought situation? And @AngryConspiracy88, @HumbleFarmer12 has invited you to share some of your evidence. Could you tell us about a specific instance that has led you to believe in a conspiracy? This can help us all understand your perspective better.",
