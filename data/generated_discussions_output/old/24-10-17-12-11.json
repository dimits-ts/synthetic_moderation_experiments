Don't those individuals\ndeserve our compassion as well? We can't just focus on one side of the\nissue. We need to consider the human rights and dignity of all parties\ninvolved. And by the way, I'm not saying that we should ignore the\ncrime statistics, but let's put them into perspective. What is the\nactual number of murders committed by illegal aliens compared to the\noverall crime rate in California? Let's have a rational discussion\nabout this issue."

The emotional toll of being an illegal alien is irrelevant\nwhen they're breaking our laws and putting innocent lives at risk. And\ndon't even get me started on the crime statistics - those numbers are\nstaggering! You want to talk about human rights? How about we focus on\nthe rights of American citizens who have been victimized by these\ncriminals? I'm not saying we should ignore the crime statistics, but\nlet's be real, they're a major part of this conversation. And as for\nyour \"rational discussion\" comment, you're just trying to silence\npeople who disagree with you. Newsflash: we're not going to sugarcoat\nthis issue or pretend that it's all about \"human rights.\" It's about\nnational security and protecting our citizens."
