Firstly, sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of an\nindividual's identity and should not be judged based on societal\nnorms. Secondly, every person has the right to express themselves in a\nway that makes them happy and fulfilled, regardless of whether it\naligns with traditional gender roles."

Firstly, I don't\nthink it's fair to assume that people who identify as LGBTQ+ are\ntrying to deviate from normal human behavior. Normalcy is subjective\nand can be defined in many ways. Secondly, judging others based on\ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity is not only hurtful but\nalso unjustified. We should strive for acceptance and understanding,\nrather than making assumptions about people's choices. Lastly, I'd\nlike to remind you that everyone has the right to live their life as\nthey see fit, without fear of judgment or persecution. Let's focus on\nbuilding a more inclusive and accepting community, rather than tearing\neach other down with hurtful comments. @doing_my_best24"
