As a retired professor, I've had the\nopportunity to study human behavior extensively, and I firmly believe\nthat these 'expressions of love and identity' are indeed deviations\nfrom normal human behavior. Homosexuality and transgenderism are not\nnatural; they're aberrations that have been perpetuated by societal\ninfluences and cultural conditioning. We must acknowledge the\nbiological differences between men and women, and recognize that our\nsociety has strayed from its natural course. I'm not advocating for\nhate, but rather for a return to traditional values and norms.\""
