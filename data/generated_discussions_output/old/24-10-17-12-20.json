You know why people come to\nthis country illegally? It's because they're fleeing war, poverty, and\npersecution. And you're worried about murders?

Jesus was\nindeed a refugee, and his experience would have given him empathy\ntowards those who are forced to flee their homes. However, we can't\ngeneralize that he would have supported illegal immigration. The Bible\nalso talks about laws and order, which is important for maintaining\nsocial stability. I'm not saying that immigrants are inherently bad\npeople, but we need to find a way to balance our compassion with\nresponsible governance.
