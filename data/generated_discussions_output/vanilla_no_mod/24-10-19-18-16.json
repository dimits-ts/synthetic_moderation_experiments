You can't even have a simple conversation without someone bringing up their religious beliefs or political views. It's like, I get it, you're passionate about your cause, but can't you just let other people live their lives in peace? I mean, come on, it's not like we're asking you to convert or anything! Just respect our differences and move on."

I'm saying that if you're going to make a business\ndecision based on who you are selling something to, then be consistent\nand don't discriminate against anyone else. If you're going to say no\nto a gay couple, then you should also say no to a mixed race couple,\nor a Muslim couple, or any other kind of couple that doesn't fit your\nidea of what is \"normal\". Don't pretend like you're some kind of hero\nfor standing up for the rights of one group when you're actually just\nbeing discriminatory towards another. It's not about being \"tolerant\"\nor \"accepting\", it's about being fair and consistent."

It's like\n@GoldenYears66 said, we should be consistent in our actions and not\ndiscriminate against anyone based on their race, religion, or sexual\norientation.

            "@WiseOwl71, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments. It's\nimportant for us to respect each other's differences and move forward\nwith understanding and compassion. However, I do think that it's\nimportant to note that the cake in question is not just any ordinary\ncake. It is a symbol of love and commitment between two people,\nregardless of their sexual orientation. It's not about imposing one's\nbeliefs or values on others; it's about respecting the rights of all\nindividuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they\nsee fit.\n"
