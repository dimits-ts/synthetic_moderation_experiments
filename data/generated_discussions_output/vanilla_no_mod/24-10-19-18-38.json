Newsflash: we can't just \"get over\" systemic oppression. It's not that simple. And by the way, what makes you think you're qualified to speak about this issue when you're a white person who has never experienced discrimination based on your race?"

Just because someone is\nwhite doesn't mean they haven't experienced discrimination or racism.\nAnd @GoldenYears66, I agree with you that we should strive to be\ncolorblind and judge people based on their character rather than the\ncolor of their skin. But we also need to acknowledge the systemic\nissues that exist in our society."

            "**Comment:** I'm shocked that no one has pointed out the obvious flaw in this argument. The original post is essentially saying that someone's race determines whether they're a terrorist or not. That's a classic example of racism, plain and simple. It's not about being \"colorblind\" or treating people as individuals; it's about recognizing that everyone deserves to be judged based on their actions, not their skin color. @GoldenYears66, I understand your frustration with systemic racism, but this post is not the solution. It's just perpetuating harmful stereotypes and dividing us further. We need to focus on addressing the root causes of racism, rather than making assumptions about people based on their race."

I understand that we should judge people based on their actions, but what if someone's actions are influenced by their environment and upbringing? What if someone is more likely to be radicalized due to systemic racism? We need to consider all factors when making judgments about individuals. @GoldenYears66, your frustration with the system is understandable, and I'm not saying that we should ignore the original post. But let's not forget that there are people who have been marginalized and oppressed for far too long. We need to listen to their voices and work together to create a more just society."

You're just\ntrying to virtue-signal by pretending to care about marginalized\ngroups while actually perpetuating the same old victim mentality.\nNewsflash: everyone is influenced by their environment and upbringing,\nbut that doesn't mean we should excuse or justify terrorism based on\nthose factors. And as for @GoldenYears66, I'm sure they're just\ntrolling us all with this post. It's a classic example of how some\npeople use race to manipulate others into doing their bidding.\nLet's not forget that the original poster is trying to make a point\nabout the double standard in our society. We need to address the\nroot causes of terrorism, and that includes recognizing the role of\nsystemic racism. @TechGuru88, you're just too blinded by your own\nwhite privilege to see the truth. #NotMyTerrorist"
