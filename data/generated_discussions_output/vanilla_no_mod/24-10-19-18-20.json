It's refreshing to see someone who understands the issue at hand. @QueenOfChaos, I'm not playing a victim card; I'm simply pointing out that this post is perpetuating harmful stereotypes and racist attitudes. It's not okay to make assumptions about people based on their skin color or ethnicity. We should strive for inclusivity and respect in our online communities."
