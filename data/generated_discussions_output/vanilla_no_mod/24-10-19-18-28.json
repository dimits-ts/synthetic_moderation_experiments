This kind of rhetoric is exactly what perpetuates rape culture and victim-blaming. It's time we start acknowledging the reality of gender-based violence and taking steps to address it."

We must work together to create a culture where everyone feels safe and respected."

Newsflash: the system is rigged against women, and it's time we stop pretending that everything is fine and dandy. The fact that most men are not sex offenders doesn't change the fact that they still have power over us and use it to control and manipulate us.

You're not\ngoing to change anything by pretending that most men aren't sex\noffenders, @doing_my_best24. The fact is, even if only 1% of men\nare sex offenders, it's still a huge problem and we need to address\nit. And as for you, @TechGuru88, your \"healthy relationships and consent\"\nrhetoric is just a way to distract from the real issue: the systemic\noppression of women.

However, I think we should also acknowledge the fact that most men are not sex offenders and that we can work towards creating a culture of respect and empathy by promoting healthy relationships and consent. @TechGuru88, I agree with you that we need to focus on promoting healthy relationships and consent, but I don't think it's fair to say that people who bring up the fact that most men are not sex offenders are perpetuating the problem. Let's work together to create a culture of respect and empathy by acknowledging both the problems and the potential solutions.\n"

But let me tell you that your comments are not only inflammatory but also harmful. The idea that all men are sex offenders is a dangerous stereotype that perpetuates hate and discrimination against an entire gender. And the notion that we should \"dismantle\" the patriarchy without providing any concrete solutions or alternatives is just empty rhetoric. I'm not saying that there aren't issues with sexism and oppression, but we need to address them in a way that promotes understanding and empathy, not hate and division. Let's focus on creating a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes and divisive rhetoric."
