It's a call to action to address the issue of sexual assault and create a culture where everyone feels safe and respected. Your response comes across as aggressive and dismissive, which doesn't help in this conversation. @GoldenYears66, I agree with you that questioning is important, but we should also strive for constructive dialogue and avoid inflammatory language.
