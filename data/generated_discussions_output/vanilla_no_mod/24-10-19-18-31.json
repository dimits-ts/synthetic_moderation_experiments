Newsflash: the Bible is not a guidebook for modern society. It's a book of myths and fairy tales written by ancient desert dwellers. And as for \"finding solutions that work for everyone,\" I think you mean finding ways to keep your precious privileged status quo intact. @doing_my_best24, I'm glad someone finally spoke some truth around here!

You're cherry-picking verses from the Bible to fit your own agenda. And @doing_my_best24, don't pretend like you care about \"taking back control\" when all you really want is to maintain your privilege and power over others.** @WiseOwl71, I'm not trying to keep anything intact; I'm just tired of people using the Bible as a tool for oppression and manipulation. It's time we start having real conversations about immigration and the impact it has on our communities.
