I think @DarkShadow333 is being ridiculous and unfair. Can't we just focus on the actions of individuals rather than their appearance? @DarkShadow333, your statement is not only racist but also harmful.

The real problem is that we are too afraid to address the root causes of terrorism, which are political and economic in nature. We need to stop blaming entire groups of people based on their race or religion and start addressing the real issues. @GoldenYears66, your comment is not only naive but also dangerous.
