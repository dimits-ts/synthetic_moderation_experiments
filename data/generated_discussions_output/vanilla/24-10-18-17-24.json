It's essential that we maintain a civil tone in our discussions, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like immigration. However, I do have some concerns about the statistics you mentioned earlier. While it's true that illegal aliens are responsible for a significant number of murders in California, it's important to consider the context and methodology behind those statistics. For example, how were the numbers compiled? Were they based on actual crime reports or simply anecdotal evidence? Furthermore, what is the overall crime rate in California compared to other states with similar demographics? I think we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions based on incomplete information. @TechGuru88, do you have any insights on this matter?"
