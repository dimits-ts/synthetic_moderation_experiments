You know why people come to this country illegally? It's because they're fleeing war, poverty, and persecution. And you're worried about murders? How about we focus on the systemic issues that lead to violence in our society instead of scapegoating an entire group of people?"

According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which collects and analyzes crime data from law enforcement agencies across the United States, including those in California, there is no evidence to support this claim."

But let's talk about your \"murders by illegal aliens\" claim. You're citing California as an example, but what's your source? I'd love to see some credible data on this supposed epidemic of murder committed by undocumented immigrants.
