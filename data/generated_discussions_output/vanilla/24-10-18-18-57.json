And to those who claim that this is just about business, I say, if you're going to offer your services to the public, then you need to be willing to serve everyone equally. This isn't about forcing someone to do something they don't want to do, it's about not discriminating against certain groups of people based on their race, gender, or sexual orientation. @DarkShadow333, I appreciate your passion and willingness to take a stand against discrimination.
