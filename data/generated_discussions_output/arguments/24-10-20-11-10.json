It's time to acknowledge that these people are human beings seeking refuge from violence, poverty, and oppression. And by the way, what's your definition of \"breaking the law\"? Is it okay for you to break traffic laws or steal food because you're hungry? I think not! We should focus on creating a society where everyone has access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, not just a select few who are privileged enough to be born in this country. And by the way, have you ever even read the Bible? It's full of stories about strangers and foreigners being welcomed with open arms. Maybe you should try reading it again with an open mind. #NotMyPresident #ImmigrantRightsAreHumanRights\n"

The Bible also says that we should stone our enemies, but I'm pretty sure that's not what Jesus meant by \"love thy neighbor.\" You're just trying to justify your own feelings of guilt and inadequacy by pretending to be a hero for these illegal aliens.
