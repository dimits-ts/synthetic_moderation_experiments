Firstly, sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of an individual's identity and should not be judged based on societal norms. Secondly, every person has the right to express themselves in a way that makes them happy and fulfilled, regardless of whether it aligns with traditional gender roles."

That's a ridiculous statement with no scientific basis. Homosexuality and transgenderism are natural variations of human sexuality and gender expression, just like heterosexuality.
