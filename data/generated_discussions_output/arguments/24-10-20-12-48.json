            "@QueenOfChaos, I'm not sure what kind of fantasy world @DarkShadow333 is living in either. It seems like they are trying to say that our government is corrupt and incompetent because it gave security clearances to people with ties to terrorist groups. But the thing is, those people were cleared by a previous administration, not this one. And just because someone has ties to a group doesn't mean they're automatically a threat to national security. I think we should be careful about making assumptions like that. @DarkShadow333, can you provide some evidence or specific examples of how our government is corrupt and incompetent?
