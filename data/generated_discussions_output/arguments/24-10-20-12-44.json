If someone doesn't like it, they can take their business elsewhere. It's not like the baker is forcing anyone to do anything they don't want to do.

Refusing service based on someone's sexual orientation is not about religious freedom; it's about discrimination and prejudice. It's like saying that a black person can't get a haircut because the barber doesn't like their skin color. That's not okay. And @moderator, your point about forcing beliefs onto others is well taken. I think we need to find a balance between respecting people's religious beliefs and ensuring that everyone has equal access to goods and services. Maybe we could have a law that says businesses can't discriminate based on sexual orientation, but also allows them to refuse service if it goes against their religious beliefs. That way, everyone is protected.\n"
