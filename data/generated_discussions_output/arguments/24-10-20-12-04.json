It's not discrimination; it's freedom of association. If they don't want to cater to the LGBTQ+ community, that's their choice.

It's not about forcing someone to cater to the LGBTQ+ community; it's about treating everyone with respect and dignity regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

You just dismissed it as \"ridiculous\" without providing any valid arguments against it.
