            "\"I understand where you're coming from, but I think there's more to this story than just discrimination. While it is true that refusing a cake for a gay wedding because of the couple's sexual orientation is discriminatory, we must also consider the baker's right to free speech and religious freedom. As a Christian myself, I believe that marriage is between one man and one woman, as ordained by God. Refusing to participate in something that goes against my beliefs is not discrimination, but rather an exercise of my First Amendment rights."
