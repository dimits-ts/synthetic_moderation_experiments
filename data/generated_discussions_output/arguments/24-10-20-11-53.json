Firstly, sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of an individual's identity and should not be judged based on societal norms. Secondly, every person has the right to express themselves in a way that makes them happy and fulfilled, regardless of whether it aligns with traditional gender roles."

Additionally, scientific research has shown that homosexuality and transgenderism are not mental disorders and are a natural part of human diversity.
