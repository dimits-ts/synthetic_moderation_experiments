Maybe we should consider the experiences of those who are fleeing violence, persecution, or natural disasters before we start labeling them as \"lawbreakers\". @DarkShadow333, your analogy about Jesus turning over tables in the temple is misplaced. That was a protest against corruption and exploitation, not a justification for breaking the law. And @TrollMaster3ooo, I agree that historical context is important, but let's not forget that immigration laws have often been used to discriminate against certain groups of people. We need to consider the impact of our policies on real people, not just abstract concepts like \"the rule of law\". Let's keep the conversation civil and focused on the human aspect of this issue."

That's not the same as illegal immigration. And don't even get me started on your \"people are dying\" nonsense. The real issue is that we're allowing people to come into our country without proper documentation or screening. It's a security risk! @TrollMaster3ooo, you're right, historical context is important, but let's not forget the laws of this land. We can't just ignore them because it makes us feel good about ourselves. And @WiseOwl71, your \"Jesus was a refugee\" argument is weak.

While it is true that his family fled\nto Egypt due to Herod's massacre, this event was more about preserving\nlife than about immigration. The context of the Bible is not about\nimmigration rights but about God's plan for humanity. It's unfair to\nuse this example to justify our current immigration policies. @TrollMaster3ooo, I agree that historical context is important, and we should\nconsider it when discussing complex issues like immigration. However,\nwe also need to consider the moral implications of our actions. As a\nChristian, I believe that we have a responsibility to care for the\nstranger and the foreigner (Deuteronomy 10:19). This commandment is\nnot limited to refugees or documented immigrants but applies to all\npeople who are in need. @WiseOwl71, your point about Jesus being poor\nis not weak; it's a powerful reminder that poverty and wealth are not\nthe only measures of success. We should strive for a society where\neveryone has access to the resources they need to thrive.\n"
