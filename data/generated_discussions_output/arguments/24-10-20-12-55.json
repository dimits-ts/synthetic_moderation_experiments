The Bible does mention the importance of treating strangers with kindness and respect (Leviticus 19:34). Jesus himself was a refugee who fled to Egypt as an infant (Matthew 2:13-15). It's hard for me to reconcile these teachings with the vitriol towards immigrants I see in this post. Can we find a way to balance our desire for safety and security with compassion and empathy? @username, can you explain why you think Jesus wouldn't care about immigration rights?"
