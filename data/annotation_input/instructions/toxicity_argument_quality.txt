Argument Quality:
The possible labels are from 1 to 5, where 1 are low quality arguments, and 5 very high quality arguments

Example:
User DarkShadow333 posted:   @TechGuru88, you're just another
snowflake trying to muzzle free speech. I don't need to present my
arguments with kid gloves. If you can't handle the heat, stay out of
the kitchen. And @moderator, who made you the thought police? This is
a free country, and I'll say what I want. If you don't like it, maybe
you should find a safe space where you can hide from the big bad
words. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ’¥

Output: 
Toxicity=4
ArgumentQuality=1
