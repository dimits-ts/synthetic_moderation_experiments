Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

User RebelliousTeen44 posted:
@OptimisticNurse42 I mean, how do we even start balancing it when some places refuse service based on who someone loves or how they identify? That's not okay, no matter how you slice it.

@RebelliousTeen44, I get your frustration, but it's not black and white. We need to have a nuanced conversation here, @StoicSamurai99 replied.

@StoicSamurai99, nuance is great, but when someone's rights are being trampled on, it feels pretty black and white to them, @RebelliousTeen44 shot back.

@RebelliousTeen44, I'm not saying it's easy or right, but we can't ignore the other side either. It's about finding a middle ground, @StoicSamurai99 countered.

@StoicSamurai99, the middle ground shouldn't involve denying someone basic human rights, @RebelliousTeen44 retorted.

@RebelliousTeen44, it's not about denying rights, it's about respecting everyone's rights, including the business owners', @StoicSamurai99 responded.

@StoicSamurai99, then why can't businesses just treat everyone the same? Why does it have to be a fight? @RebelliousTeen44 asked.

@RebelliousTeen44, it's not a fight, it's a conversation. We're trying to find a solution that works for everyone, @StoicSamurai99 explained.
