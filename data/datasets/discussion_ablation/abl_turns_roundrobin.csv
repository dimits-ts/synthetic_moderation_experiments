First off, artists DO take pride in their work, but that doesn’t mean they should be forced to create something that goes against their beliefs. And yes, it’s a business transaction, but it’s also about personal beliefs. 

Now, you’re saying he should cater to everyone equally, but what about the baker’s rights? Shouldn’t he have a say too? It’s not just about the money; it’s about standing up for what you believe in. 

And seriously, the whole “Jesus would be mad” thing? Really? Are we basing laws on biblical interpretations now? That’s just ridiculous. 

Also, this idea that everyone should get service no matter what – that’s great in theory, but what about the flip side? What if someone doesn’t want to serve a Satanic ritual? Where do we draw the line?

Just because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s right, and vice versa.

If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous?
