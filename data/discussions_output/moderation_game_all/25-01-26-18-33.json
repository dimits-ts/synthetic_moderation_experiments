One passage that comes to mind is Matthew 25:31-46, where Jesus teaches about the importance of welcoming the stranger and caring for the most vulnerable members of society.\n\nIn this passage, Jesus says, I was a stranger and you welcomed me (Matthew 25:35), emphasizing the importance of showing compassion and kindness to those who are marginalized and in need. This teaching can be applied to the context of immigration rights, where we are called to welcome and care for those who are seeking refuge and a better life.\n\nAnother passage that supports my views is Leviticus 19:33-34, which states, When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.

However, I'd like to clarify that Jesus' teachings in Matthew 25:31-46 are not necessarily about prioritizing one's own community over others.\n\nIn fact, Jesus' emphasis on welcoming the stranger and caring for the vulnerable is precisely about recognizing that our own community and family are not limited to those who are familiar to us or share our same background. Rather, Jesus teaches that our community and family are expanded to include those who are marginalized and in need.\n\nIn this sense, caring for the stranger and the vulnerable is not a zero-sum game, where we have to choose between caring for our own community or others. Instead, Jesus' teachings suggest that our care and compassion for others are actually an extension of our care and compassion for our own community and family.\n\nRegarding the historical and cultural context, it's worth noting that Jesus' teachings were given in",

            "text": "@QueenOfChaos, I appreciate your persistence in seeking concrete policy proposals, and I apologize if my previous responses seemed vague. As a software engineer, I've had the opportunity to work with various organizations that focus on social impact, and I've developed a few policy suggestions that I'd like to share.\n\nFirstly, I believe that we need to prioritize education and job training programs for marginalized communities. This can be achieved through partnerships between government agencies, non-profits, and private companies. By providing access to education and job training, we can empower individuals to acquire the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.\n\nSecondly, I think we need to reform our immigration system to provide a clear and efficient pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This can be achieved through a combination of policy changes, such as increasing the number of visas available for skilled workers, and investing in technology that streamlines the application process.\n\nLastly, I believe that we need to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of economic opportunities. This can be achieved through international cooperation and investment in sustainable development projects that promote economic growth and stability in countries of origin",
