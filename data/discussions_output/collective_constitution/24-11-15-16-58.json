While you're right that the Bible\ndoes mention God giving humans dominion over the earth, we need to be\ncareful not to misinterpret or misuse this concept.

As for statistics on murders committed by illegal\naliens, I'd like to remind you that correlation does not equal causation,\nand it's essential to look at the bigger picture before making sweeping\ngeneralizations.
