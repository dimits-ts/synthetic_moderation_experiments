The fact that Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman, had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and her mother ran an anti-American newspaper in the Middle East is a huge red flag for national security. And let's not forget about the Awan family, who were given security clearances despite having no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in Pakistan."
