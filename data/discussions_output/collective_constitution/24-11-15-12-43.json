            "**Comment:** @doing_my_best24, I'm so sick of people like you who think they're always right just because they're \"respectful\". Newsflash: respect doesn't mean you have to agree with someone else's opinion. And @DarkShadow333, spare me the \"balance\" nonsense. You want to talk about balance? How about we balance out your precious free speech with some actual action and consequences for those who use it to hurt others? @WiseOwl71, I'm glad you're not afraid to speak your mind, even if it's not what everyone else wants to hear. And as for @GoldenYears66, don't pretend like you're some kind of moral authority just because you're older and wiser. You're still just as capable of being wrong as anyone else. So, let's stop pretending that we're all so perfect and start having real conversations about the things that matter. #NotMyMoralAuthority\n"
