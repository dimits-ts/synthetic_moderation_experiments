As a historian, I've seen firsthand how human behavior, including sexuality and gender identity, has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. To dismiss these variations as deviations is not only inaccurate but also dangerously close to the kind of thinking that has caused harm and oppression throughout history. I'd urge you to engage with the vast body of research that exists on this topic before making such sweeping statements.\n\n@LostInThought52, I wholeheartedly agree with your response. The idea of a normal human behavior is a social construct, often used to marginalize and oppress those who don't fit into a narrow, often arbitrarily defined, norm. It's crucial that we challenge these constructs and strive for a more inclusive and understanding society.\n\n@moderator, thank you for your intervention.
