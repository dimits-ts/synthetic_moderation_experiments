            "@GoldenYears66, I understand your point that everyone should be able to make their own choices when it comes to buying a cake for their wedding. However, I must remind you that discrimination is not just about refusing to sell someone a cake, but also about the underlying reasons behind such refusal. In this case, the baker's refusal to sell a cake to a gay couple is based on their religious beliefs, which can be seen as discriminatory towards the LGBTQ+ community. It's important to consider the impact of our actions and words on others, even if we don't intend to cause harm."

            "@GoldenYears66, thank you for your thoughtful response. You make a valid point that there are more important issues to focus on than a single cake. However, it's also important to recognize that this issue is not just about the cake itself, but about the values and principles that underlie the decision to refuse service based on personal beliefs or biases. Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"take a step back and think about the bigger picture\"? What do you think we should be focusing on instead?"

As a retired professor, I've had to navigate many complex and sensitive topics in my academic career. In this case, the baker has a right to refuse service based on their religious beliefs, just as others have the right to choose not to patronize that business. It's all about respecting each other's differences and boundaries."
