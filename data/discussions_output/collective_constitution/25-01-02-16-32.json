This should be taught to both boys and girls, and it should be ongoing, not just a one-time lesson.\n\nI also think we need to challenge toxic masculinity and the idea that men have to be aggressive or dominant. This can be done through media representation, open conversations, and by supporting men who are trying to break free from these expectations.\n\nLastly, we need to support survivors and make sure they have access to resources and a safe space to heal. This includes believing them when they come forward, providing them with counseling and legal support, and creating a culture where they feel safe to speak up.\n\nLet's not forget that this is a complex issue with many layers, and it's going to take all of us working together to make a change.",

It's crucial to create an environment where men feel comfortable expressing their emotions and not conforming to outdated gender norms. And yes, survivors need a safe space and resources to heal.\n\nI'd like to add that technology can also play a role in education and support. There are numerous apps and online platforms that provide resources on consent, healthy relationships, and support for survivors. We could advocate for these tools to be integrated into school curriculums and made more accessible to the public.\n\nMoreover, we should encourage open dialogue and storytelling from survivors. This can help break the stigma and show others that they're not alone. It's a powerful way to educate and empower both men and women.\n\nLet's keep the momentum going, everyone.
