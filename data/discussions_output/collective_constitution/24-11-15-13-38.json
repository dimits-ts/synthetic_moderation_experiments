            "I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the fact that Jesus was an immigrant himself. He was born in Bethlehem, which is outside of Israel, and he had to flee to Egypt with his family when King Herod ordered the massacre of all the male children in Bethlehem. So, it's ironic that some people use the Bible to justify anti-immigrant sentiments. It's important to remember that Jesus' own story is one of migration and displacement, and we should be more compassionate towards those who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families."
