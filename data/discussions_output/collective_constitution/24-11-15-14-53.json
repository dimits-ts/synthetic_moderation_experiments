            "**Comment:** @DarkShadow333, I understand your frustration with the government's handling of national security, but I have to disagree with some of the points you made. Firstly, Huma Abedin's connections to the Muslim Brotherhood are not as clear-cut as you make them out to be. While it is true that her mother runs an anti-American newspaper in the Middle East, there is no concrete evidence linking Huma herself to any terrorist organizations."
