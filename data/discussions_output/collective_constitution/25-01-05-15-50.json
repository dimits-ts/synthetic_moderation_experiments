I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

Freedom of speech and religion protect the baker's right to choose what messages he promotes. As for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy.

The baker's refusal was indeed based on the customers' sexuality, regardless of the message on the cake. It's a clear case of discrimination. If a baker refuses to make a cake for a black couple because they don't want to promote interracial marriage, would that be acceptable? The message on the cake is just a smokescreen.\n\nAnd @TechGuru88, you're absolutely right. The baker didn't refuse to write a specific message, he refused to serve a gay couple. That's textbook discrimination. As for the biblical interpretation, I'm not religious, but I've heard that Jesus was all about love and acceptance, not turning people away based on who they love.\n\nLet's not forget, this isn't about freedom of speech or religion. It's about a business refusing service to a group of people based on their sexuality. That's not okay, and it's not legal. Let's not twist the facts to fit a narrative that supports discrimination.",
