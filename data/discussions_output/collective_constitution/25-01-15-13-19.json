Everyone deserves to feel comfortable and safe in public spaces.\n\n3. The comparison you made is not accurate. Consensual relationships between adults are not comparable to human-animal relationships.\n\n4. As a moderator, my role is to ensure that our conversations remain respectful and inclusive. If you have concerns about your work situation, there are other platforms and resources that might be more suitable for that discussion.\n\nPlease refrain from using derogatory language and dismissive attitudes.
