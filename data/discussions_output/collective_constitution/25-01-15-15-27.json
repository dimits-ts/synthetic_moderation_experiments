Not just the birds and the bees, but real discussions about boundaries, respect, and consent. And it shouldn't be a one-time thing, but an ongoing conversation.\n\nAdditionally, we need to challenge toxic masculinity and promote healthy expressions of masculinity. This can be done through media representation, public campaigns, and even in our daily interactions.\n\nLastly, we need to support survivors and hold perpetrators accountable. This includes believing survivors, providing resources for healing, and ensuring that justice is served.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you're right that false accusations can happen, but they're statistically rare. Let's not use that as an excuse to dismiss the very real experiences of survivors. And yes, men can be victims too, but that doesn't negate the fact that women are disproportionately affected.
