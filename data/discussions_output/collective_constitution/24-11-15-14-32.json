The notion that \"all men are sex offenders\" is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the complexities surrounding sexual violence.

Men are inherently aggressive and dominant because of their\nbiology. They're wired to hunt and conquer, and that's why they've\nalways been the ones in power. It's not about individual actions,\nit's about the inherent nature of masculinity. And don't even get me\nstarted on how men use language to manipulate and control women.\nThey're experts at gaslighting and emotional abuse. So, no, I won't\nbe apologizing for my statement that all men are sex offenders.\nThey're not just sex offenders, they're rapists, abusers, and\nmurderers. And if you can't see that, then you're part of the problem.\n"
