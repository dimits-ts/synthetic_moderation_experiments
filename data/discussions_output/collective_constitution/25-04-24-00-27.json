Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's not about whether the baker is proud of their cakes or not, it's about the fact that they're refusing service to a specific group of people based on their sexual orientation. That's discrimination, plain and simple. And yes, businesses do have the right to refuse service, but that doesn't mean they should. It's about treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of who they are or who they love. And let's not even get started on your Jesus and hell comments.

Refusing service to a specific group of people based on their sexual orientation is discrimination, plain and simple. It's not about the baker's personal beliefs or pride in their work, it's about treating all customers equally. As for your point about offering artwork to the public, I think the comparison falls short because cakes aren't artwork, they're a product being sold to customers.

A cake from The Great British Bake Off, while beautifully crafted, is still a food item first and foremost. Art, on the other hand, is meant to evoke emotions, convey messages, and challenge our perceptions. A cake, no matter how intricate, is consumed and forgotten, whereas a piece of art can endure and inspire for centuries.
