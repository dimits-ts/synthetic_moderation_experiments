I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous?

If a baker refused to make a cake for a straight wedding because they didn't agree with the message of marriage, would you still call it discrimination?\n\nAnd yes, artists do take pride in their work, but they also have the right to choose what work they create. A painter doesn't have to paint a mural they disagree with, and a baker doesn't have to create a cake that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might be discriminated against doesn't mean all groups will. And no, Satanists can't discriminate against Christians just because a baker might refuse to make a cake. That's not how the law works.\n\nLet's not forget, the baker in this case was willing to sell the gay couple any other cake in his shop.

Even if the baker doesn't intend to discriminate, the couple may still feel discriminated against.\n\n@FirstUser, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this.
