They're just as valid and beautiful as heterosexuality. It's time to accept that people come in all shapes, sizes, genders, and sexualities. Stop trying to dictate what is 'normal' and start respecting people for who they are. And by the way, what's with this obsession with labeling things as 'deviations'?
