And her mother's newspaper? That's a bit of a stretch. As for the Awans, there's no concrete evidence linking them to terrorism. It's easy to throw around accusations, but where's the proof? And let's not forget, the majority of government employees are career civil servants who serve under both Republican and Democratic administrations. They're not all 'lazy liberals'. Maybe it's time to look at the system, not just the people in it. But hey, that's just my two cents.",
