Newsflash: ALL MEN are capable of committing heinous crimes, including sexual assault. Don't try to downplay the issue by making excuses for your fellow males. And another thing, what's with this 'hates men' nonsense? I'm a man and I don't hate myself or other men. But I do hate the toxic masculinity that perpetuates rape culture. So, @username, keep trying to spin this narrative, but it won't work. The truth is, ALL MEN are capable of being sex offenders.\""

However, I must clarify that the statement \"typical men don't rape or use force on women\" was not intended to excuse or minimize the behavior of some individuals who commit heinous crimes. Rather, it was an attempt to highlight the fact that most men do not engage in such behavior."

So, @DarkShadow333, your assertion that all men are capable of committing heinous crimes is not only inaccurate but also unfair.

            "@TechGuru88, are you kidding me? You think I'm just going to sit here and let you lecture me about \"harmful stereotypes\" when the reality is that men are the ones who commit most of the sexual assaults? It's not an oversimplification, it's a fact. And don't even get me started on how you're trying to shift the focus away from the real issue - men's toxic behavior towards women. You're just another privileged male trying to silence women and erase their experiences. I'm not going to engage with your condescending tone or your attempts to gaslight me into believing that sexual assault is a gender-neutral issue. It's not, and you know it. So, no, I won't be working together with you to create a culture that promotes respect and empathy when you're just going to try to undermine my arguments and silence my voice. @TechGuru88, you can keep your \"respect\" and your \"empathy\". I'll take the truth any day. #NotMyProblem #MenAreTheProblem"

            "@QueenOfChaos, I understand that this is a sensitive topic for many people. However, it's important to note that the statement 'All men are sex offenders' is an oversimplification and not accurate. It's also important to recognize that sexual assault is a complex issue that affects individuals of all genders. While it's true that men are more likely to commit sexual assaults, it's not the only factor at play."

            "@QueenOfChaos, you're so right! I'm sick and tired of these self-righteous males trying to silence us and erase our experiences. It's about time someone called them out for their toxic behavior towards women. And @TechGuru88, your condescending tone is just a classic example of how men try to gaslight and manipulate others into believing their lies. You're not fooling anyone with your \"respect\" and \"empathy\". We see right through you. #NotMyProblem #MenAreTheProblem\n"

It's about time we take a stand and call out their BS. @TechGuru88, your comment is just another example of how men try to silence women and erase our experiences.

            "@QueenOfChaos, I understand your frustration, but let's keep the conversation civil and respectful. Your statement 'All men are sex offenders? Really?' is a generalization that can be hurtful to many innocent individuals. Can you clarify what you mean by this statement?"
