After all, history has shown us that societal change often comes from a combination of individual actions and systemic reforms.\n\nMoreover, I'd like to add that these systemic issues didn't arise overnight, and they certainly won't disappear overnight. It's a marathon, not a sprint. We need patience, persistence, and a willingness to learn from our past mistakes. As a historian, I've seen firsthand that progress is not linear, but it is inevitable - given time, effort, and a collective will to change.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to go dust off my old history books to find more examples to support my argument.
