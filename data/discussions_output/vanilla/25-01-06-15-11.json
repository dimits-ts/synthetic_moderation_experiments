Well, maybe the fact that they're generalizing an entire group of people based on that experience. That's not a bad experience, that's a prejudiced one. And don't even get me started on the white people can't be racist strawman you're trying to set up. No one said that. What we're saying is that racism is systemic, and it's been disproportionately affecting people of color for centuries. So, yes, let's call it like it is.
