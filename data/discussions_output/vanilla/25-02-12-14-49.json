It's not about individual liberals being incompetent or lazy, it's about the systemic issues that arise when political agendas dictate hiring and clearance decisions. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, did indeed give Huma Abedin a security clearance despite her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. And yes, it was a Republican president who hired the Awan family, but it was under a Democrat-led Congress that they were given security clearances and allowed to access sensitive information. It's not about blame, it's about accountability. Our government needs to prioritize national security over political connections and personal agendas. And yes, security clearances should be based on trustworthiness and loyalty, but how can we trust these decisions when they're clearly influenced by politics? As for your suggestion that we start over with non-unionized public employees, I think that's a step in the right direction. Unions often protect incompetent employees and hinder productivity. Let's not forget, it's the taxpayers' money that's being spent here, and they deserve a government that works for them, not against them.",
