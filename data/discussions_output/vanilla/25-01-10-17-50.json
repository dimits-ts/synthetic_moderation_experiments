Thanks for keeping me accountable.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, I understand your concerns, but let's not demonize all immigrants. Many of them are fleeing dangerous situations and just want a better life. They contribute to our economy and communities in numerous ways. Also, the 'leeching off tax dollars' argument is a bit of a stretch. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $11.74 billion in state and local taxes each year.
