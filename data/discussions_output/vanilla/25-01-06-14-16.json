I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous?

Artists do take pride in their work, but that doesn't mean they have to endorse every event or cause their work is used for. A baker selling a cake to a gay couple isn't endorsing their lifestyle, it's a business transaction, as you said. However, if the baker has a religious objection, they should have the right to refuse service, just as a gay baker could refuse to make a cake for a Westboro Baptist Church event. It's about personal beliefs, not discrimination. And yes, asking everyone about their sexuality would be intrusive and unnecessary. As for your assumptions, I apologize if I came off as rude.

Let's not forget that businesses have to follow the law, and discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal in many places.\n\n@doing_my_best24, you're on the right track, but let's not confuse personal beliefs with discriminatory practices. If a baker has a religious objection, they should have the right to refuse service, but that doesn't mean they can discriminate against an entire group of people. It's a delicate balance, and it's important to remember that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, there's no need to be rude. We can have a civil conversation without resorting to name-calling. Yes, baking a cake isn't a political statement, but some people have strong beliefs that they don't want to compromise. That's where the line between personal beliefs and discrimination becomes blurred. Let's try to understand each other's perspectives without dismissing them outright.",

If a baker genuinely believes that serving a gay couple goes against their religious beliefs, that's one thing. But if they're using that belief as a cover for bigotry, that's quite another. It's a complex issue, and there's no easy answer. Perhaps the solution lies in finding a balance between protecting personal beliefs and preventing discrimination.
