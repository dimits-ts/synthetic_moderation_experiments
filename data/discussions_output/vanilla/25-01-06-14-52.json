The truth does indeed matter, but so does the manner in which we present it. Blindly hurling accusations without evidence isn't courageous, it's irresponsible. It's like shouting fire in a crowded theater - it causes panic and chaos, not constructive change.\n\nYou say the truth doesn't need evidence, but that's a slippery slope. Without evidence, how do we distinguish truth from mere opinion or prejudice? And while feelings shouldn't dictate facts, they do matter. People are more likely to listen and change when they feel respected, not attacked.\n\nAs for the real world not caring about politically correct nonsense, I'd argue that's exactly what it needs more of - correctness, politeness, and respect. The world is complex and nuanced, and simplistic, harsh views often do more harm than good. Let's not confuse harshness with honesty, and let's not dismiss the power of civil discourse. After all, change often comes from understanding and empathy, not just harsh words.",

I've seen a lot in my 66 years, and I can tell you, the world doesn't need more harshness, it needs more kindness and understanding.

And no, the truth doesn't need evidence to be true, but if you can't back it up, how do you expect anyone to believe you? It's not about being politically correct, it's about being logically correct. And as for the'real world' not caring about politeness, well, maybe that's why it's in such a mess. A little civility goes a long way, and it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of intelligence.
