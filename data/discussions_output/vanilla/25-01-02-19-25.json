History has shown us that once we start making exceptions based on personal beliefs, it can lead to a slippery slope of discrimination. For instance, in the past, businesses refused service to African Americans or interracial couples based on their personal beliefs.\n\nThe key here is to find a balance between freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment. A baker refusing to create a custom cake for a gay wedding could be seen as a form of discrimination, as they are denying a service based on the customers' sexual orientation. It's not just about the cake, but the message it sends.\n\nLet's remember that the law protects people from discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. This isn't about forcing anyone to do something against their beliefs, but about ensuring that everyone has access to the same services and opportunities.\n\n@GoldenYears66, you're right that we",

You're right, the slippery slope argument isn't entirely a red herring, and we should be mindful of the precedent we're setting.

If the baker is genuinely uncomfortable with creating a custom cake for a gay wedding due to their personal beliefs, that's one thing. But if the refusal is rooted in prejudice or a desire to discriminate, that's a different story.\n\nI also think it's important to consider the message it sends to the LGBT",

The message sent by a baker refusing service to a gay couple is that their love and commitment are less valid, which can be incredibly hurtful and damaging.\n\nMoreover, the law doesn't just consider intent; it also looks at the effect of one's actions. If a baker's refusal to serve a gay couple leads to that couple feeling humiliated, excluded, or less than, then it's still a form of discrimination, regardless of the baker's intent.\n\n@DarkShadow333, I'd be interested in hearing your response to these points.
