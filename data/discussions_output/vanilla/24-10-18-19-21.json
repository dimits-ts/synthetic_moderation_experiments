You're saying that someone who judges another person based on their race is not racist? That's a dangerous and ignorant statement. Racism isn't just about hating people of other races; it's also about using stereotypes and prejudices to make assumptions about them. And the post you're defending is doing exactly that. It's perpetuating harmful stereotypes about brown people being terrorists. @GoldenYears66, I understand your frustration with double standards, but this post is not an example of that.
