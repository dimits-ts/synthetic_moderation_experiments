There are plenty of good men out there who respect women and don't engage in such behavior. We need to focus on the individuals who commit these crimes rather than generalizing an entire gender."

That's just a way of saying \"women should just be grateful they're not being assaulted by strangers.\" Newsflash, @TechGuru88: most women are already aware of the risks of sexual assault, but that doesn't mean we should have to live in fear of our own shadows."

It is unfair and unjust to make such sweeping statements. @QueenOfChaos, you mentioned that men are disproportionately represented in sex offender statistics. That may be true, but we should not forget that there are many good men out there who do not engage in such behavior. We must also consider the fact that women can also commit sexual offenses and that they are underrepresented in these statistics."

And I agree that women can also be\nperpetrators of sexual offenses, but let's not forget the power dynamic\nat play here. Men have historically held more power and control over\nwomen, which makes them more likely to commit these crimes.
