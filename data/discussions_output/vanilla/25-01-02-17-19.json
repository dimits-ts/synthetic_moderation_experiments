Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.\" This principle of loving and welcoming the stranger is repeated throughout the Bible.\n\n@TechGuru88, you're absolutely right that Jesus was a refugee, and the Bible does emphasize loving our neighbors and treating others with kindness and respect. However, we should also acknowledge that the Bible doesn't provide a blueprint for modern immigration policy. It's a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both compassion and practicality.\n\n@moderator, thank you for reminding us to keep the conversation respectful. To address your question, @FirstUser, perhaps we could discuss the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37). This story illustrates the importance of showing compassion to those in need, regardless of their background or status.
