Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

Forcing a baker to create something that goes against their beliefs is akin to compelling an artist to paint a mural they disagree with. The slippery slope argument may not be a red herring; it's a legitimate concern. Where do we draw the line? Can a Jewish baker be forced to bake a Nazi-themed cake? The principle of equal treatment under the law is crucial, but so is the principle of freedom of belief and expression. Let's not dismiss the baker's rights in our quest to protect the couple's.
