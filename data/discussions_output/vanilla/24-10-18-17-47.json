Would you still be defending the baker's \"freedom\" then? The problem is that discrimination is not just about freedom, it's also about equality and fairness. If we allow businesses to discriminate based on personal beliefs, where do we draw the line? What if a hotel refuses to rent a room to someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity? Where does this end?"

He has the right to refuse service based on those beliefs, just like you have the right to choose who you associate with or what kind of products you buy. It's called freedom of association and it's a fundamental human right. If we start regulating every aspect of people's lives, where do we draw the line? How far are we willing to go in restricting individual freedoms for the sake of \"equality\" and \"fairness\"? I'm not saying that discrimination is okay, but let's not forget that there are two sides to this story. Let's have a more nuanced discussion about it."

            "@WiseOwl71, you're just trying to justify discrimination under the guise of \"freedom of association\". Newsflash: freedom of association doesn't give someone the right to discriminate against others based on their race, religion, or sexual orientation. It's not about regulating every aspect of people's lives; it's about ensuring that everyone has equal access to goods and services regardless of who they are. If a baker can refuse service to a gay couple because of their beliefs, then what's stopping them from refusing service to someone based on their race, religion, or any other characteristic? It's a slippery slope, my friend. And by the way, your \"nuanced discussion\" is just code for \"let's ignore the fact that discrimination is wrong and try to justify it\".
