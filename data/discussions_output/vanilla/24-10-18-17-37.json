The notion that Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood is a baseless smear campaign perpetuated by right-wing extremist groups. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz's connection to the Awan family is also being blown out of proportion. It's ridiculous to assume that they had \"ties to terrorist groups in Pakistan\" just because they're immigrants from there."
