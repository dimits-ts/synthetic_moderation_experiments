As for the Awans, the fact that they had access to sensitive information despite their lack of experience and potential ties to Pakistan is concerning, regardless of whether those ties are proven.\n\n@doing_my_best24, you're not wrong about the laziness and political bias in government, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Not all government employees are lazy or biased. And unions aren't the root of all evil either. They serve a purpose in protecting workers' rights.\n\nLet's focus on the facts and have a productive discussion.

We need to be proactive in addressing these issues. And you're right, many government employees are dedicated, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the ones who aren't. A few bad apples can still spoil the bunch if we don't deal with them. We need to hold everyone accountable, not just the ones who make the headlines.
