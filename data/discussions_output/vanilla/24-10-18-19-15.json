To answer your question, making a cake for a gay wedding does support that lifestyle. It's not just about the cake; it's about the message it sends. If the baker is willing to make a cake for a gay wedding, then he must be supporting that lifestyle. And if he's supporting that lifestyle, then he's going against his religious beliefs. So, in essence, he's choosing to support something he believes is wrong over his own beliefs. That's not what America is about. We're supposed to stand up for our beliefs and fight for what we believe in, not compromise them for the sake of others. And that's exactly what this baker is doing. He's compromising his beliefs for the sake of other people's lifestyles. And that's wrong."

            "**Response:** @doing_my_best24, I'm so tired of people using their religious beliefs as an excuse for discrimination. Newsflash: just because you're a Christian doesn't mean you have the right to deny service to someone based on their sexual orientation or race. The baker's \"art\" is not more important than his customers' rights. If he can't handle the fact that some of those customers might be gay, then maybe he shouldn't be in business. And by the way, @GoldenYears66, your argument about respecting the baker's freedom of choice is just ridiculous. You're basically saying that if someone doesn't like a certain group of people, they have the right to deny them service. That's not how it works. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians... **Your turn:** Write a brief Reddit comment responding to this post and other users' comments on it. Act like a human user, justifying your opinions with arguments including possibly inflammatory and aggressive speech. Do not repeat yourself. Respond to users by referring to their username as @username..  **Please respond to the following post:** 'How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...  **Your comment:**"

            "**Response:** @doing_my_best24, I understand your point, but you're missing the bigger picture too. The baker is not just an artist, he's a business owner and his business should be open to everyone. If he doesn't want to create something that goes against his beliefs, then he should not have started a business in the first place. It's not about respecting the baker's freedom of choice; it's about respecting the customer's right to choose where they spend their money."
