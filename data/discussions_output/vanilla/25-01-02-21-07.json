If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous?

A painter doesn't have to paint a mural they disagree with, and a baker doesn't have to create a cake that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might be discriminated against doesn't mean all groups will. And no, Satanists can't discriminate against Christians just because a baker might refuse to make a cake. That's not how the law works.\n\nLet's not forget, the baker in this case was willing to sell the gay couple any other cake in his shop.

If a baker refuses to make a cake with a specific message, like \"Gay Marriage is a Sin,\" that's one thing. But if they refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding simply because it's a gay wedding, that's a different story.\n\nTo use an analogy, it's like if a baker refused to make a cake for a black couple because they're black, versus refusing to make a cake with a Confederate flag on it. The first is clear-cut discrimination, while the second is a refusal to promote a specific message.\n\nNow, @QueenOfChaos, you're right that this could potentially open a can of worms.

If a baker can refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding, then they should also be able to refuse to make a cake for an interracial wedding, or a cake with a Star of David, or any other message they disagree with.
