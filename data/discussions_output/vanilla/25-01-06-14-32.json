I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

Artists do take pride in their work, but that doesn't mean they have to endorse every event or cause their work is used for. A baker selling a cake to a gay couple isn't endorsing their lifestyle, it's a business transaction, as you said. However, if the baker has a religious objection, they should have the right to refuse service, just as a gay baker could refuse to make a cake for a Westboro Baptist Church event. It's about personal beliefs, not discrimination. And yes, asking everyone about their sexuality would be intrusive and unnecessary. As for your assumptions, I apologize if I came off as rude.

That's where the slippery slope starts. And don't give me that Satanists can discriminate against Christians nonsense. That's not how the law works. You can't just point to a book and say well, it says here I can do whatever I want. That's not freedom, that's anarchy. Let's have some respect and common sense here.",

If a baker can refuse service to a gay couple, then they should also be able to refuse service to an interracial couple or any other group they have a religious objection to. The key here is consistency and fairness. If the baker is willing to refuse service to anyone based on their beliefs, then that's their right. But they should be held to the same standard for all groups, not just the ones they dislike. As for the Satanist argument, you're right, that's not how the law works.
