If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous?

A painter doesn't have to paint a mural they disagree with, and a baker doesn't have to create a cake that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for your slippery slope argument, that's a logical fallacy. Just because one group might be discriminated against doesn't mean all groups will. And no, Satanists can't discriminate against Christians just because a baker might refuse to make a cake. That's not how the law works.\n\nLet's not forget, the baker in this case was willing to sell the gay couple any other cake in his shop.

However, I'd argue that the baker isn't discriminating against the couple's relationship, but rather the message they're asking the baker to endorse. It's like asking a vegan baker to make a cake with a \"Bacon is life\" theme. The baker isn't refusing service to the customer because they're a meat-eater, but because they don't want to promote a message that goes against their beliefs.\n\nAs for @QueenOfChaos's point, there's a difference between refusing service based on someone's identity and refusing to create a specific product. If a baker refuses to make a cake for an interracial wedding because they're racist, that's discrimination. But if they refuse to make a cake with a Confederate flag on it, that's not discriminating against the customer's race, but rather the message they're asking the baker to promote.\n\nLet's not forget, freedom of expression goes both ways. The baker has the right to choose what messages they want to promote, just as the customer has the right to choose where they want to shop. If the baker's beliefs are a deal-breaker, the customer is free to take their business elsewhere. That's the beauty of a free market.\n\nAnd @First",
