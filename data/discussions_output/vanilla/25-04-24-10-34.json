While the Bible may not explicitly mention immigration rights, Jesus' teachings of love, compassion, and welcoming the stranger (Matthew 25:35-40) can certainly be interpreted as supportive of fair immigration policies. As for your question, according to the California Attorney General's office, in 2020, undocumented immigrants made up 3.5% of California's population but accounted for 2.8% of its homicide arrests. This is not a significant deviation from their population proportion. Let's not demonize a group based on fear and misinformation.",

I believe we should be guided by scripture, but also by logic and the facts at hand.\n\n@EmpatheticNurse45, I see your concern, but I must echo @HistoryBuff99's point. The statistics you're asking for don't tell the whole story. We should be more interested in the individuals behind these numbers, not just the numbers themselves. Let's not forget that immigrants, regardless of their status, are people, not just statistics.\n\nI'm not here to argue or provoke, but to encourage a thoughtful discussion.
