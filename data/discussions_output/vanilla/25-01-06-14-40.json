A baker's belief doesn't give them the right to refuse service to someone based on their sexual orientation. That's not 'live and let live', that's 'live and let discriminate'.\n\n@TechGuru88, you hit the nail on the head. This isn't about 'live and let live'. It's about equal rights and fair treatment. If we allow this kind of discrimination, where do we draw the line? It's a slippery slope, and we can't afford to go down that path.\n\nLet's not mince words here.
