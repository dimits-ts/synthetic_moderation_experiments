I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

While it might seem like a simple business transaction to us, for them, it could be a matter of deeply held beliefs. I don't think anyone should be forced to create something that goes against their conscience. However, I also believe that businesses should be open to all customers, regardless of their personal beliefs. Maybe a compromise could be found, like referring the customer to another baker who would be comfortable with the request?\n\n@DarkShadow333, I agree that it's about principle, but I think it's also about respect and understanding. Just because someone doesn't agree with your beliefs, doesn't mean they should be denied service. And while it might not be about race or gender, it is about a part of someone's identity that they can't change. I think it's important to consider the impact our actions have on others, even if we don't agree with their choices.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation respectful.

If a baker doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding, that's their right, but it's also their right to be called out for discrimination. It's not about forcing someone to create something they don't believe in, it's about not denying service to someone based on who they are. And yes, it is about a choice, but it's a choice that's deeply personal and fundamental to someone's identity. As for Jesus, I'm pretty sure he'd be more concerned about the lack of love and acceptance than a cake. \ud83d\ude12\n\n@doing_my_best24, I appreciate your perspective, but I think the compromise you're suggesting is just a polite way of saying we don't want your business. It's like saying, Sure, we'll serve you, just not here. That's not equality, that's segregation. And yes, it's about respect and understanding, but that goes both ways. The baker should respect the customer's right to be who they are, just as the customer should respect the baker's beliefs. But when those beliefs lead to discrimination, that's where the line is drawn.\n\n@moderator, thanks for keeping the peace.
