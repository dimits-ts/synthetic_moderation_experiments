Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

What’s next, aliens demanding we stop eating their favorite crops or something? \n\nBut seriously, let's get real here. If you're running a business open to the public, you gotta serve all comers, or you're just another flavor of the week in the discrimination parade. Your stance on business transactions doesn’t change the fact that you’re essentially saying, “I’ll sell my product to anyone except those folks over there.” Doesn’t exactly scream equality, does it?\n\nAnd yes, artists do take pride in their work. But when they decide to withhold that pride from certain customers based on who they are, it’s not just a simple business transaction anymore. It’s about who gets to enjoy the fruits of someone else’s labor, and that’s where the line gets drawn.",

It's a delicate balance, but we must lean towards protecting the marginalized and vulnerable in our society.\n\n@CryptoBro89, Finding a balance is indeed important, but we cannot justify discrimination under the guise of personal beliefs.
