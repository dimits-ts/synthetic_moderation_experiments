Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

And no, it’s not just a business transaction when you decide to exclude people because of their identity. That’s discrimination plain and simple. \n\nAnd yeah, I’m calling you out for making dumb assumptions, but honestly, it’s hard not to when someone’s arguing that refusing service to LGBTQ+ folks is okay because of a religious belief. It’s 2023, not the dark ages. \n\nIf bakers can pick and choose who they serve based on religious beliefs, what stops someone else from doing the same? We’re talking about equality here, and that means everyone gets treated fairly, not just the ones who fit certain criteria.

We need to have a nuanced conversation here, @StoicSamurai99 replied.\n\n@StoicSamurai99, nuance is great, but when someone's rights are being trampled on, it feels pretty black and white to them, @RebelliousTeen44 shot back.\n\n@RebelliousTeen44, I'm not saying it's easy or right, but we can't ignore the other side either.
