Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

It's not about supporting a lifestyle, it's about equal rights and equal service. And let's not forget, the baker could've simply refused to decorate the cake with a message that went against their beliefs, but they chose to refuse the entire service based on the couple's sexual orientation.

While I understand the principle of treating all customers equally, there are limits to what businesses should be forced to do. A baker shouldn't be compelled to create a cake that goes against their deeply held beliefs, especially when there are plenty of other bakeries willing to serve anyone. It's not about cherry-picking customers, it's about freedom of conscience. And yes, it's about more than just cakes, but it's also about protecting the rights of business owners to run their businesses according to their beliefs.",

It's a bit of a strawman argument, isn't it?
