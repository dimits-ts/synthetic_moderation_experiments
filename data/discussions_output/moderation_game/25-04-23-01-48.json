It's crucial we stick to facts and avoid demonizing entire groups. However, let's not forget that the Awan brothers were indeed suspected of espionage and were initially investigated for that. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence, but to dismiss the initial concerns as mere fear-mongering is disingenuous.\n\n@moderator, thank you for keeping the conversation civil. It's a delicate balance, isn't it? We must hold our government accountable, but we must also avoid painting entire groups with the same brush. It's a fine line to walk.",
