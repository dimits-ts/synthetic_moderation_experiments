We've got our fair share of scumbags, sure, but to say all men are sex offenders is as ridiculous as saying all women are gold-diggers. It's a lazy, oversimplified argument that doesn't help anyone. And @ReclusivePoet31, while I appreciate the attempt at nuance, let's not forget that men are also victims of sexual assault and harassment. It's not a one-sided issue.

They're not saying all men are sex offenders, but rather that our society has a systemic issue with men committing sexual assault and harassment. It's not about individual men, but the culture that allows and often enables these behaviors. And while it's true that men can also be victims, we're talking about the overwhelming power dynamics at play here.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your reminder, but I think it's important to call out the elephant in the room. We're not here to pretend everyone's a misunderstood soul. Some people, indeed, are just assholes, and they're often the ones perpetuating these harmful behaviors.\n\n@OptimisticNurse42, I'm sorry if my previous comment came across as dismissive.
