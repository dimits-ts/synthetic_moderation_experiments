Huma Abedin's security clearance was thoroughly vetted by the FBI, and there's no credible evidence linking her to terrorist groups. And as for the Awan family, they were investigated by the FBI and cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nYour rant about government employees being lazy and liberal is just that - a rant. It's not based on any facts or evidence. And by the way, union contracts are in place to protect workers' rights, not to coddle them. You can't just negate them and start over again. That's not how it works.\n\nI'm disappointed, but not surprised, by your lack of understanding of how government works.
