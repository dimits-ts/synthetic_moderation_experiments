            "text": "Thank you, Moderator, for the opportunity to respond to Mr. Trump's assertions and present my own vision for immigration reform.\n\nFirst and foremost, I must say that I strongly disagree with Mr. Trump's characterization of our immigration system as a total disaster. While there are certainly challenges and complexities to our system, it is not a disaster. In fact, our country has a long and proud tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world, and our diversity is one of our greatest strengths.\n\nRegarding the wall, I must say that I am deeply concerned about the proposal to build a physical barrier along our southern border. Not only is it a costly and ineffective solution to the complex issues surrounding immigration, but it also sends a harmful message about who we are as a country. We are a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that heritage.\n\nInstead of building walls, I believe we should be investing in smart and effective border security measures that prioritize the safety and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This includes investing in technology, increasing the number of border patrol agents, and improving our asylum and refugee processing systems.\n\nI also strongly disagree with Mr. Trump's assertion that Mexico will pay for the wall. This is a false promise that has been repeatedly debunked, and it is not a realistic or responsible solution to our immigration challenges.\n\nRegarding Mr. Trump's claims about his own success in dealing with immigrants, I must say that I am skeptical. While he may have made some deals with immigrant-owned businesses, his record on immigration is one of division, fear-mongering, and xenophobia. His proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country, to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and to deny citizenship to the children of undocumented immigrants are all examples of his harmful and misguided approach to immigration.\n\nAs President, I would take a very different approach. I would prioritize a comprehensive and humane immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increased funding for refugee resettlement programs, and a commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all immigrants, regardless of their status.\n\nI would also work to address the root causes of migration, including poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity in the countries from which many immigrants flee. This includes investing in economic development programs, increasing our foreign aid budget, and working with international partners to address the global migration crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that our immigration system is not a disaster, but rather an opportunity for us to come together as a country and build a more just and inclusive society. I am committed to working towards a comprehensive and humane immigration reform that reflects our values as a nation of immigrants, and I hope that Mr. Trump will join me in this effort.",

As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and won, securing billions of dollars in relief for homeowners who were affected by the foreclosure crisis.

My proposal for a pathway to citizenship is very simple: we're going to make a great deal with the immigrants who are already here, and we're going to make them pay for the privilege of becoming citizens. It's going to be a beautiful deal, believe me.\n\nNow, regarding the specifics, I've already said that we're going to make a great deal. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We're going to work with these immigrants, and we're going to make sure that they're paying their fair share. It's going to be a tremendous deal, folks. Just tremendous.\n\nAs for the root causes of migration, I've already told you that we're going to make deals with these countries. We're going to make them so prosperous, so strong, that nobody's going to want to leave. And we're going to work with international partners to make sure that we're addressing the global migration crisis.\n\nNow, I know that Senator Harris is going to try to attack me on this, but let me tell you, folks, I'm a winner. I'm a champion.

But I can tell you that we're going to make some of the greatest deals in the history of the world. We're going to make deals that are going to benefit these countries, and we're going to make deals that are going to benefit America.\n\nSo, Senator Harris can talk all she wants, but at the end of the day, I'm the one who's going to get things done. I'm the one who's going to make America great again. And I'm the one who's going to fix our immigration system, once and for all.

She wants to know how my proposal for a pathway to citizenship would work in conjunction with my border security measures. Well, let me tell you, folks, it's very simple. We're going to make sure that we're securing our borders, and we're going to make sure that we're making a great deal with the immigrants who are already here.\n\nAs for prioritizing the deportation of undocumented immigrants over providing a pathway to citizenship, let me tell you, folks, we're going to do both. We're going to make sure that we're deporting the people who are here illegally, and we're going to make sure that we're providing a pathway to citizenship for those who are here legally.\n\nAnd as for ensuring that my deals with countries would address the root causes of migration, let me tell you, folks, we're going to make sure that we're addressing the root causes of migration. We're going to make deals with these countries that are going to benefit them, and we're going to make deals that are going to benefit America.\n\nSo, Senator Harris can try to attack me all she wants, but at the end of the day, I'm the one who's going to get things done.

You'd have to pass a test, a very tough test, that would show you have a good understanding of American history, American values, and the English language.

However, I must point out that while you provided some general ideas about the requirements for citizenship and the test, you still didn't provide specific details about the content of the test, the fee, or the deals with countries.\n\nSenator Harris raised some important concerns about the potential cultural bias of the test and the fairness of the fee. Could you please provide more specific details about how you would ensure that the test is not culturally biased and that the fee is not prohibitively expensive for low-income immigrants?\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that you would invest in programs to help people in other countries, but you didn't provide any specifics about what those programs would be or how they would be funded. Could you please provide more information about your plan to address the root causes of migration?\n\nI'd like to remind you that we're running low on time, and I'd like to move on to the next question. However, I want to make sure that we're providing the American people with a clear understanding of your proposal. Please take 30 seconds to provide more specific details about your plan.",

I must say that I'm still not convinced that Mr. Trump's proposal is a comprehensive and humane solution to the complex issue of immigration reform.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump mentioned that the test would be very comprehensive and very fair, he still didn't provide any specific details about the content of the test or how it would be designed to ensure that it's not culturally biased. He also didn't provide any information about the fee, including how much it would be or how it would be waived or reduced for low-income immigrants.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Trump's proposal to invest in programs to help people in other countries is still vague. He didn't provide any specifics about what those programs would be or how they would be funded. It's unclear how these programs would address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity.\n\nIn contrast, my proposal includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain requirements, such as paying taxes, passing a background check, and learning English. It also includes measures to address the root causes of migration, such as increasing foreign aid to Central America and investing in programs that promote economic development and stability.\n\nI believe that the American people deserve a clear and honest answer to these questions, and I hope that Mr. Trump will finally provide one.",

And it's going to be designed by the best experts, the best minds in the business. They're going to make sure that it's fair, that it's not culturally biased. We're going to have a committee, a committee of experts, that are going to oversee the test, make sure it's fair, make sure it's great.\n\nNow, regarding the fee. The fee is going to be very reasonable, very reasonable. We're going to make sure that it's not prohibitively expensive for low-income immigrants. We're going to have a sliding scale, a sliding scale of fees, that are going to be based on income. So, if you're a low-income immigrant, you're going to pay a lower fee. If you're a high-income immigrant, you're going to pay a higher fee. It's going to be very fair, very reasonable.\n\nNow, regarding the programs to address the root causes of migration. We're going to invest in programs that are going to help people in other countries. We're going to invest in programs that are going to promote economic development, stability, and security. We're going to work with countries to make sure that they have the resources they need to take care of their own people. We're going to invest in programs that are going to help people in Central America, in particular. We're going to invest in programs that are going to help people in Mexico, in particular.\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, these programs are going to be huge. They're going to be tremendous. They're going to be so successful, so successful. And they're going to be funded by a combination of government funding, private funding, and funding from other countries. We're going to make sure that these programs are fully funded, fully funded.\n\nSo, folks, that's my proposal. It's a great proposal, a fantastic proposal. And I believe it's the best proposal out there, the best proposal to make America great again, and to fix our immigration system once and for all. Believe me, it's going to be huge.",
