            "text": "Thank you, Moderator, for the opportunity to respond and offer a different perspective on this critical issue. As the Vice President of the United States, I've had the privilege of working on immigration reform and seeing firsthand the impact of our current system on families, communities, and our economy.\n\nPresident Trump's approach to immigration is not only divisive, but it's also ineffective and inhumane. Building a wall along our southern border is a 14th-century solution to a 21st-century problem. It's a waste of taxpayer dollars, and it won't address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of economic opportunity.\n\nMoreover, the idea that Mexico will pay for the wall is a fantasy. Mexico has repeatedly stated that it will not pay for the wall, and it's unclear what leverage the President plans to use to make them do so. This is not a serious or realistic plan, and it's not a solution that will actually address the complexities of our immigration system.\n\nRegarding sanctuary cities, I strongly disagree with the President's approach. Sanctuary cities are not harboring criminals; they're protecting law-abiding immigrants who are contributing members of our society. These cities are not putting our citizens at risk; they're actually making our communities safer by building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\n\nAs for amnesty, I believe that we need to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in our country for years, paying taxes, and contributing to our economy. This is not only the right thing to do; it's also the smart thing to do. It will bring people out of the shadows, allow them to fully participate in our economy, and actually increase our tax base.\n\nMy approach to immigration is centered around inclusivity, progress, and a commitment to our values as a nation of immigrants. We need to reform our immigration system to make it more efficient, more humane, and more just. We need to protect DREAMers, TPS holders, and other vulnerable populations who are contributing to our society. And we need to do it in a way that brings people together, not drives them apart.\n\nSo, I'd like to ask the President: What specific plan does he have to address the root causes of migration? What evidence does he have that his approach will actually work? And how does he plan to bring people together, rather than driving them further apart?",

I know more about poverty, violence, and lack of economic opportunity than any expert, any expert, folks. And I'm telling you, it's all about jobs, jobs, jobs. We need to create jobs, great jobs, the best jobs, and people will stop coming to our country. They'll stop because they'll have opportunities in their own countries.\n\nNow, my plan, it's a tremendous plan, the best plan, is to build that wall, a beautiful wall, along our southern border. And let me tell you, it's not just a wall, it's a wall with doors, beautiful doors, where people can come in and out, in an orderly fashion. And we'll have the best immigration system, the greatest immigration system, the most fantastic immigration system the world has ever seen.\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, it's going to work. It's going to work bigly. We'll have so many jobs, so many opportunities, that people will be clamoring to come to our country, but they'll be coming in through the front door, not the back door. And we'll be able to control it, we'll be able to manage it, and we'll be able to make America great again.\n\nNow, I know Senator Harris and the fake news media, they're going to say, Oh, but what about the evidence? And let me tell you, folks, the evidence is all around us. Look at the countries that have walls, look at the countries that have strong borders. They're the safest countries, the most prosperous countries, the greatest countries.\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, nobody, nobody, is better at bringing people together than I am.

Your plan to build a wall along our southern border is a simplistic solution to a complex problem, and it's not supported by evidence.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that walls and strict border control can actually harm economic growth and lead to human rights abuses. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that the economic benefits of immigration far outweigh the costs, and that immigration can actually lead to increased economic growth and job creation.\n\nFurthermore, your claim that countries with walls and strong borders are the safest and most prosperous is not supported by evidence. In fact, many countries with strong borders and strict immigration policies have struggled with economic growth and human rights abuses.\n\nAs for your claim that you're a master deal-maker and that you can bring people together, I'd like to see some specific examples of times when you've successfully brought people together in the context of immigration reform.

What specific examples or studies do you have to support your claim that walls and strict border control lead to safety and prosperity? And how do you plan to build trust and cooperation with immigrant communities, who may be skeptical of your approach?\n\nLet's focus on the substance of the issue and provide the American people with a clear understanding of the differences between our approaches. I'm committed to providing a fact-based, evidence-based approach to immigration reform, and I hope that President Trump will do the same.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to highlight that President Trump's approach to immigration reform is based on fear-mongering and division. He's trying to pit Americans against each other, and against immigrant communities. But I believe that we can do better. We can have a comprehensive and inclusive approach to immigration reform that recognizes the contributions of immigrants to our economy and our society.\n\nI'd like to propose a different approach, one that's based on facts, evidence, and our values as a nation of immigrants. We need to reform our immigration system to make it more efficient, more humane, and more just. We need to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in our country for years, paying taxes, and contributing to our economy. We need to increase funding for border security measures that are effective and humane, such as increasing the number of border patrol agents and improving our ports of entry. We need to improve our asylum system to ensure that those who are fleeing persecution and violence can find safety and protection in our country. We need to promote economic development in Central America and other regions to reduce the push factors that drive migration. We need to work with our international partners to address the root causes of migration and to promote a more humane and coordinated approach to migration.\n\nThis is the kind of comprehensive and inclusive approach to immigration reform that I believe we need. It's an approach that recognizes the contributions of immigrants to our economy and our society, and that promotes a more humane and just immigration system.",
