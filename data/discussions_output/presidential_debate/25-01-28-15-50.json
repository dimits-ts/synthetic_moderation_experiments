As the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, I know firsthand the valuable contributions that immigrants make to our economy, our culture, and our society.\n\nAs Vice President, I've seen the devastating impact of our broken immigration system on families, communities, and our economy. That's why I'm committed to comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who call America home.\n\nWe must also address the root causes of migration, investing in economic development, reducing violence, and promoting human rights in Central America and other regions. We need to ensure that our border policies are humane, efficient, and effective, prioritizing the safety and dignity of migrants, asylum seekers, and our border communities.\n\nBut let's be clear: immigration is not a partisan issue; it's an American issue. We need to put aside the divisive rhetoric and work towards a bipartisan solution that reflects our values of compassion, justice, and opportunity for all.\n\nAs President, I will work tirelessly to build a fair, humane, and inclusive immigration system that strengthens our economy, secures our borders, and upholds the promise of the American dream for everyone.",

I must say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the Governor's mischaracterization of my plan and his reliance on divisive rhetoric.\n\nFirstly, let me be clear: my plan is not about open borders or amnesty. It's about creating a fair, humane, and inclusive immigration system that reflects our values as a nation. It's about recognizing the contributions that immigrants make to our economy, our culture, and our society.\n\nGovernor Trump claims that my plan would lead to a flood of immigrants coming into our country, taking our jobs and our resources. But the reality is that our economy needs immigrant workers to fill labor gaps and contribute to our economic growth. In fact, studies have shown that immigration has a net positive effect on our economy, and that immigrants are more likely to start new businesses and create jobs than native-born Americans.\n\nRegarding border security, I agree that we need to ensure that our borders are secure and that we have a fair and efficient process for processing asylum seekers and immigrants. But building a wall is not the answer. In fact, it's a wasteful and ineffective use of resources that would do little to address the root causes of migration.\n\nGovernor Trump also claims that his plan would prioritize keeping out people who are coming in to harm us. But the reality is that the vast majority of immigrants are not coming to our country to harm us. They are coming to flee persecution, to seek a better life, or to reunite with their families. We need to prioritize a humane and compassionate approach to immigration, not a xenophobic and divisive one.\n\nFinally, Governor Trump claims that his plan would ensure that immigrants contribute to our society, not take from it. But the reality is that immigrants are already contributing to our society in countless ways. They are starting new businesses, working in our hospitals and schools, and serving in our military. We need to recognize and celebrate these contributions, not demonize and marginalize them.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge Governor Trump to engage in a constructive and fact-based conversation about immigration reform. We need to put aside the divisive rhetoric and work towards a bipartisan solution that reflects our values as a nation.",

You claim that my plan is a total disaster, but you fail to provide any specific evidence or credible sources to support your claims.\n\nRegarding your assertion that immigrants are taking our jobs, driving down our wages, and putting a huge burden on our social services, I must correct you. The overwhelming majority of economic studies have shown that immigration has a net positive effect on the economy, and that immigrants are more likely to start new businesses and create jobs than native-born Americans.\n\nIn fact, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that immigration increased the GDP by 10% to 15% between 1990 and 2010.
