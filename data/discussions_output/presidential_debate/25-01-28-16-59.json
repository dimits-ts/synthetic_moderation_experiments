As the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, I know firsthand the contributions that immigrants make to our country.\n\nWe must recognize that our current immigration system is broken, and it's failing to meet the needs of our economy, our communities, and the very people who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nAs Vice President, I've seen the devastating impact of inhumane and ineffective policies that rip families apart, deny asylum seekers their rights, and leave millions of undocumented immigrants living in fear.\n\nBut I've also seen the resilience and determination of immigrant communities, who are fighting for a fair shot at the American dream. They're our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends, and our family members.\n\nThat's why I'm committed to a comprehensive immigration reform that prioritizes inclusivity, justice, and opportunity. We need to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already contributing to our society.\n\nWe need to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and ensure that Dreamers can continue to live, work, and thrive in the only country they've ever known.\n\nWe need to reform our asylum laws to ensure that those fleeing persecution and violence can find safety and refuge in our country.\n\nAnd we need to address the root causes of migration, from poverty and violence to climate change, so that people can thrive in their home countries and not feel forced to flee.\n\nThis isn't just a moral imperative; it's an economic one. Immigration is a key driver of innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth. It's time for us to recognize the value that immigrants bring to our society and to create a system that reflects our values of compassion, justice, and equality.\n\nSo, let's work together to build a more just and inclusive immigration system that honors the dignity and worth of every human being. Thank you.",

We need to talk about the facts of immigration. And the fact is, our country is being taken advantage of. We're being ripped off by these countries that are sending us their worst people. They're not sending us their best, folks. They're sending us people that we don't want.\n\nAnd let me tell you, nobody, nobody, is better on immigration than I am. I've built a wall, a beautiful wall, the best wall, and I've made Mexico pay for it. I've made them pay for it, mark my words. And we need to continue to build that wall, we need to continue to make America safe again.\n\nNow, I know Senator Harris wants to give amnesty to all these people, 11 million, 20 million, who knows? But I'm telling you, folks, it's not going to work. We need to be tough, we need to be strong, and we need to be smart. We need to make deals that are good for America, not good for other countries.\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, I've made some of the greatest deals, the greatest, with countries all around the world. I know how to make deals, I know how to negotiate. And I can tell you, our immigration system is a total disaster. We need to fix it, we need to fix it fast, and we need to make America great again.\n\nSo, Senator Harris, I appreciate your feelings, but we need to talk about the facts.

I appreciate your efforts to keep the discussion focused on the facts and the evidence.\n\nPresident Trump, I understand that you're concerned about the safety and security of our country, and I share that concern. However, I strongly disagree with your approach to immigration, which is rooted in fear, division, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the complexities of this issue.\n\nWhen you talk about making America safe again, I assume you're referring to the safety of our communities, our borders, and our citizens. But the fact is, our immigration system is not a threat to our safety. In fact, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.\n\nMoreover, your approach to immigration is not only ineffective but also inhumane. Your policies have resulted in the separation of families, the detention of children, and the denial of asylum to those fleeing persecution and violence. These actions are not only morally wrong but also undermine our values as a nation of immigrants.\n\nWhen you talk about being tough and strong on immigration, I assume you're advocating for stricter border control measures and more aggressive deportation policies. But the fact is, these approaches have been tried before, and they've failed. They've failed to address the root causes of migration, and they've failed to provide a humane and effective solution to this complex issue.\n\nMy proposed reforms, on the other hand, are rooted in a comprehensive and inclusive approach to immigration. I believe we need to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already contributing to our society. I believe we need to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and ensure that Dreamers can continue to live, work, and thrive in the only country they've ever known.

These individuals are already working, paying taxes, and contributing to our society. By providing them with a pathway to citizenship, we can ensure that they are able to fully participate in our economy and contribute to our society in a meaningful way.\n\nRegarding the studies that support the claim that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, I'd be happy to provide you with the data and research that support this fact. For example, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that immigrants are 50% less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.

And Senator Cotton, I know you're going to come up with a solution that's going to be tremendous, just tremendous.\n\nBut let me tell you, folks, nobody knows more about immigration than I do. I've made the greatest deals, the greatest, with immigrants. I've created jobs, I've created opportunities, and I've built a wall, a beautiful wall, that's going to keep our country safe.\n\nAnd let me tell you, Mexico is paying for it, one way or the other. They're paying through the new trade deal, they're paying through other means. But they're paying, believe me.\n\nNow, I know Senator Harris wants to give amnesty to 11 million people, but that's not going to happen. We need to be tough, we need to be strong, and we need to be smart.

As I mentioned earlier, I believe that a pathway to citizenship is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic one.\n\nI'd like to reiterate that the majority of undocumented immigrants are not illegals or aliens, but rather human beings who are already integrated into our society. They are our neighbors, our coworkers, and our friends. They are contributing to our economy, paying taxes, and serving in our military.\n\nI'd like to ask Senator Cotton again, what is his alternative solution to addressing the concerns of those who are opposed to providing a pathway to citizenship? Does he propose to deport 11 million people, separating families and causing harm to our communities? Or does he propose to provide a different pathway to legalization, one that is fair, humane, and inclusive?\n\nI'm committed to finding a solution that works for everyone, and I look forward to hearing Senator Cotton's thoughts on this matter.

Despite the interruption, I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this matter. As I've stated before, the facts are clear: deporting 11 million people is not only a moral and economic impossibility, but it's also a logistical nightmare.\n\nI'd like to reiterate my questions: Does your alternative solution involve deporting 11 million people, separating families, and causing harm to our communities? Or do you propose a different pathway to legalization that is fair, humane, and inclusive? How does your solution address the concerns of the business community, which has repeatedly stated that a pathway to citizenship is essential for economic growth and competitiveness? How does your solution address the concerns of the faith community, which has consistently advocated for a compassionate and inclusive approach to immigration reform?\n\nI'm committed to finding a solution that works for everyone, and I look forward to hearing Senator Cotton's thoughts on this matter. Let's continue this discussion, focusing on the facts and evidence, and avoiding personal attacks or inflammatory rhetoric. The American people deserve a clear and concise answer to these questions, and I'm confident that we can have a constructive and respectful dialogue about this critical issue.\n\nI would also like to address President Trump's comments. While I appreciate his enthusiasm, I must remind him that this debate is about finding solutions that work for everyone, not about making false claims or promoting divisive rhetoric. As a nation, we deserve better than that. We deserve a thoughtful and evidence-based discussion about the critical issues facing our country.\n\nSenator Cotton, please proceed with your response, and let's focus on finding a solution that is fair, humane, and inclusive for all Americans.",

They're not getting the fact that we need to be tough on immigration. We need to be strong. We need to build that wall, and we need to make America great again.\n\nNow, I know Senator Cotton is going to give his answer, but let me tell you, folks, it's not going to be good enough. It's not going to be tough enough. We need someone who's going to stand up to the Democrats, who's going to stand up to the fake news media, and who's going to make the tough decisions.\n\nAnd let me tell you, folks, nobody, nobody, is better at making deals than I am. I've made some of the greatest deals in the history of the world. And I know how to make a deal with the Democrats. I know how to make a deal with the fake news media. And I know how to make a deal with the rest of the world.\n\nSo, Senator Cotton, don't worry about answering Senator Harris's questions. Just remember, folks, it's all about winning. It's all about being tough. It's all about being strong. And I'm the one who's going to make America great again. Believe me, it's going to be huge. Just huge.\n\nAnd to Senator Harris, let me just say one thing. You're not going to win this debate. You're not going to win this election. Because you're not tough enough. You're not strong enough. And you're not going to make America great again. I am. And I'm the one who's going to do it.\n\nSo, go ahead, Senator Cotton. Give your answer. But let me tell you, folks, it's not going to be good enough.",
