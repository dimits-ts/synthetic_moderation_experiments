However, I'd like to clarify a few points and provide an opportunity for your opponent to respond.\n\nFirstly, regarding the wall and Mexico's payment, can you provide specific details on how you plan to negotiate with Mexico to cover the costs? What mechanisms would you use to ensure their cooperation?\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that your opponent wants to give amnesty to millions of people who are here illegally. I'd like to give your opponent a chance to respond to this claim and provide their actual stance on immigration reform.\n\nLet's also ground our discussion in evidence. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the number of apprehensions at the southern border has been declining over the past few years. How do you respond to this data, and how would your policies address the complexities of immigration?\n\nLastly, I'd like to remind our audience that we're here to have a constructive dialogue. Let's focus on the issues rather than making personal claims or attacks. Your opponent will now have a chance to respond to your statements.",

            "text": "Thank you, Moderator, for the opportunity to respond and set the record straight. I appreciate your efforts to ground our discussion in evidence and focus on the issues at hand.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to address the claim that I want to give amnesty to millions of people who are here illegally. That's simply not true. As a former Attorney General of California and a United States Senator, I've consistently advocated for comprehensive immigration reform that prioritizes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as paying taxes, passing background checks, and learning English.\n\nMy proposal is not a free pass or amnesty; it's a fair and earned pathway that recognizes the contributions these individuals have already made to our society. It's also a matter of economic and social justice. We have 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country, many of whom have been here for decades, working hard, paying taxes, and contributing to our communities.\n\nRegarding the wall, I strongly disagree with my opponent's proposal. Not only is it a waste of taxpayer dollars, but it's also a symbol of division and fear. We should be investing in smart, effective, and humane border security measures that prioritize technology, personnel, and infrastructure, not a physical barrier that will do little to address the complexities of immigration.\n\nTo address the complexities of immigration, we need a comprehensive approach that includes a pathway to citizenship, protections for DREAMers and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, and a focus on addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and corruption in Central America.\n\nI'd also like to respond to the data on apprehensions at the southern border. While it's true that the number of apprehensions has declined in recent years, it's also true that we've seen an increase in asylum seekers and refugees fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. We need to address the humanitarian crisis at our border with compassion, empathy, and a commitment to upholding our values as a nation of immigrants.\n\nFinally, I'd like to say that this debate is not just about policy; it's about who we are as a people. Do we want to be a nation that fears and rejects the stranger, or do we want to be a nation that welcomes and includes the stranger? I believe we should be the latter, and I'm committed to working towards a more inclusive, more compassionate, and more just immigration system that reflects our values as Americans.",

I've done more in two years than she's done in her entire career. And let me tell you, my wall is going to be a beautiful thing, believe me. It's going to keep out the bad guys, the criminals, the gangs, and it's going to keep in the good guys, the people who want to work hard and contribute to our society.\n\nNow, about Mexico paying for the wall. I've already spoken to the Mexican president, and he's agreed to pay for it. It's going to be a small price to pay for the security and the safety that we're going to provide to our country. And let me tell you, it's not just about the wall. It's about the whole border security system. We're going to have the best technology, the best personnel, and the best infrastructure to keep our country safe.\n\nRegarding asylum seekers and refugees, I'm a compassionate person, believe me. I want to help people who are fleeing violence and persecution. But we have to do it in a way that's fair and safe for our country. We can't just let anyone in, no matter what. We have to have a system that works, that's fair, and that's safe.\n\nAnd let me tell you, Senator Harris's proposal for a pathway to citizenship is just a bunch of empty promises. It's not going to work. We need a system that's based on merit, that's based on skill, that's based on what people can contribute to our society. We can't just give citizenship away to anyone who wants it. That's not how it works.\n\nSo, I think my proposal is the best way to go.

I must say, I'm disappointed but not surprised by his lack of understanding of the complexities of immigration and his reliance on divisive rhetoric.\n\nFirstly, regarding Mexico paying for the wall, I'd like to know what specific agreements Mr. Trump has made with the Mexican president. Has he actually secured a commitment from Mexico to pay for the wall? Or is this just another empty promise? The fact is, Mexico has repeatedly stated that they will not pay for the wall, and it's unclear what Mr. Trump's plan is to make them do so.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to address Mr. Trump's comment about my proposal being a disaster and letting in all the bad guys. I'd like to know what specific examples he's referring to. Is he talking about the fact that I've introduced legislation to protect DREAMers and TPS recipients? Or is he talking about my proposal to increase funding for border security and immigration enforcement? I'd like to know what specific policies he's referring to, and how his own proposal addresses the complexities of immigration.\n\nThirdly, I'd like to address Mr. Trump's comment about asylum seekers and refugees. I agree that we need to have a system that's fair and safe for our country, but I disagree with his approach. We can't just turn our backs on people who are fleeing violence and persecution. We need to provide a safe and fair process for asylum seekers and refugees to apply for protection, and we need to increase funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America.\n\nFinally, I'd like to say that I'm committed to finding common ground and exploring solutions that address the complexities of immigration. However, I will not engage in divisive rhetoric or scapegoating of immigrant communities. We need to have a respectful and civil dialogue about immigration, and we need to prioritize a comprehensive and inclusive approach that recognizes the contributions of all immigrants to our society.\n\nIn response to Mr. Trump's comments, I'd like to provide more specific details on how my proposal would address the concerns about border security and public safety. My proposal includes increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement, as well as implementing a more efficient and effective asylum process that prioritizes the safety and security of our country. I'd also like to clarify that my proposal is not a free pass or amnesty, but rather a recognition of the contributions that undocumented immigrants have already made to our society. It's a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that prioritizes a fair and earned pathway for those who meet certain criteria, such as paying taxes, passing background checks, and learning English.\n\nI believe that we can have a secure and safe border without resorting to divisive rhetoric or scapegoating of immigrant communities. We need to prioritize a comprehensive and inclusive approach that recognizes the contributions of all immigrants to our society, and we need to have a respectful and civil dialogue about immigration.",

Additionally, my proposal includes providing a safe and fair process for asylum seekers and refugees to apply for protection, and increasing funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America.\n\nRegarding the specific mechanisms I would use to ensure that the asylum process is fair, efficient, and effective, I would propose the following: Firstly, I would increase funding for the asylum corps to ensure that asylum officers have the necessary resources and training to process asylum claims in a fair and efficient manner. Secondly, I would implement a more streamlined and efficient asylum process that prioritizes the safety and security of our country, while also ensuring that asylum seekers and refugees have access to a fair and impartial process. Thirdly, I would increase funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America to address the root causes of migration and provide support to those who are fleeing violence and persecution.\n\nI hope this clarifies my proposal and addresses the specific points raised by Mr. Trump.

Or is he talking about my proposal to increase funding for border security and immigration enforcement? I'd like to know what specific policies he's referring to, and how his own proposal addresses the complexities of immigration.\n\nThirdly, I'd like to address Mr. Trump's comment about asylum seekers and refugees. While I agree that we need to have a system that's fair and safe for our country, I disagree with his approach. We can't just turn our backs on people who are fleeing violence and persecution. We need to provide a safe and fair process for asylum seekers and refugees to apply for protection, and we need to increase funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America.\n\nRegarding my proposal, I'd like to clarify that it includes increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement, as well as implementing a more efficient and effective asylum process that prioritizes the safety and security of our country. My proposal is not a free pass or amnesty, but rather a recognition of the contributions that undocumented immigrants have already made to our society. It's a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that prioritizes a fair and earned pathway for those who meet certain criteria, such as paying taxes, passing background checks, and learning English.\n\nFinally, I'd like to say that I'm committed to finding common ground and exploring solutions that address the complexities of immigration. However, I will not engage in divisive rhetoric or scapegoating of immigrant communities. We need to have a respectful and civil dialogue about immigration, and we need to prioritize a comprehensive and inclusive approach that recognizes the contributions of all immigrants to our society.\n\nTo answer your question, Moderator, my proposal addresses the concerns about border security and public safety in a way that is fair and inclusive to all immigrants. For example, my proposal includes increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement, as well as implementing a more efficient and effective asylum process that prioritizes the safety and security of our country. Additionally, my proposal includes providing a safe and fair process for asylum seekers and refugees to apply for protection, and increasing funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America.\n\nRegarding the specific mechanisms I would use to ensure that the asylum process is fair, efficient, and effective, I would propose the following: Firstly, I would increase funding for the asylum corps to ensure that asylum officers have the necessary resources and training to process asylum claims in a fair and efficient manner. Secondly, I would implement a more streamlined and efficient asylum process that prioritizes the safety and security of our country, while also ensuring that asylum seekers and refugees have access to a fair and impartial process. Thirdly, I would increase funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America to address the root causes of migration and provide support to those who are fleeing violence and persecution.\n\nI hope this clarifies my proposal and addresses the specific points raised by Mr. Trump.

We need a proposal that's going to address the root causes of migration, provide a fair and efficient process for asylum seekers and refugees, and recognize the contributions of undocumented immigrants to our society.\n\nSecondly, regarding Mr. Trump's comment about Mexico paying for the wall, I'd like to say that this is simply not true. Mexico has repeatedly stated that they will not pay for the wall, and it's unclear what specific agreements Mr. Trump has made with the Mexican president, and what mechanisms he would use to ensure their cooperation.\n\nThirdly, regarding my proposal, I'd like to clarify that it includes providing a safe and fair process for asylum seekers and refugees to apply for protection. This process would include increasing funding for the asylum corps, implementing a more streamlined and efficient asylum process, and increasing funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America.\n\nTo ensure that this process is fair, efficient, and effective, I would propose the following mechanisms: Firstly, I would increase funding for the asylum corps to ensure that asylum officers have the necessary resources and training to process asylum claims in a fair and efficient manner. Secondly, I would implement a more streamlined and efficient asylum process that prioritizes the safety and security of our country, while also ensuring that asylum seekers and refugees have access to a fair and impartial process. Thirdly, I would increase funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America to address the root causes of migration and provide support to those who are fleeing violence and persecution.\n\nI hope this clarifies my proposal and addresses the specific points raised by Mr. Trump. Thank you, Moderator, for the opportunity to respond.\n\nRegarding Mr. Trump's statement about providing a comprehensive approach, I'd like to say that his proposal is not comprehensive.

We need a proposal that's going to address the root causes of migration, provide a fair and efficient process for asylum seekers and refugees, and recognize the contributions of undocumented immigrants to our society.\n\nIn contrast, my proposal is based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of migration, provides a fair and efficient process for asylum seekers and refugees, and recognizes the contributions of undocumented immigrants to our society. For example, my proposal includes increasing funding for humanitarian assistance and development programs in Central America, which would help to address the root causes of migration and provide support to those who are fleeing violence and persecution.\n\nI believe that my proposal is a more effective and humane approach to addressing the complexities of immigration. It's a proposal that's based on facts, evidence, and a commitment to fairness, justice, and compassion. I hope that Mr. Trump will consider my proposal and work with me to find common ground and explore solutions that address the complexities of immigration.",

I appreciate your emphasis on the importance of a comprehensive and inclusive approach that recognizes the contributions of all immigrants to our society.\n\nMr. Trump, I would like to give you an opportunity to respond to Senator Harris's comments and address some of the specific points she raised.
