The phrase All men are sex offenders is a gross oversimplification, yes, but it's born from a place of valid frustration. It's a reaction to the systemic issues of toxic masculinity and male entitlement that pervade our society. It's not about hating men or healthy sex, it's about challenging the harmful behaviors that are too often excused or ignored because they're committed by men.\n\n@moderator, I understand the need for respectful dialogue, but let's not shy away from the uncomfortable truths. The fact is, men have historically held positions of power and privilege, and with that comes a responsibility to examine and challenge our own behaviors. It's not about demonizing men, it's about holding them accountable.\n\nAs for what constitutes healthy and normal sexual behavior, I'd argue it's anything that's consensual, respectful, and considerate of all parties involved. It's about communication, mutual pleasure, and understanding that no means no, and only yes means yes. It's about recognizing that sex is not a right to be taken, but a gift to be given and received.",

It's not about blaming all men, but about encouraging all men to hold each other accountable and challenge harmful behaviors when they see them.\n\nI understand where you're coming from when you say that women can also be predators and manipulators. Absolutely, that's true. But the power dynamics and societal expectations are different for men and women. Toxic masculinity is a product of a society that expects men to be dominant, aggressive, and unemotional. It's about challenging these expectations and promoting healthier, more balanced views of masculinity.\n\nI agree with you on the importance of respect, consent, and mutual pleasure in sexual behavior. That's a universal principle, regardless of gender.
