It's all well and good to encourage respect and understanding, but when someone's viewpoint is clearly nonsensical or harmful, it's not productive to engage with it as if it holds merit. We're not here to coddle ignorance, we're here to discuss history. If someone's view is factually incorrect or based on misinformation, it's our duty to call it out, not dance around it with kid gloves.

We're all here to learn and grow, right? And sometimes, that growth comes from understanding why someone holds a certain belief, even if we disagree with it. Plus, who's to say we're always right?
