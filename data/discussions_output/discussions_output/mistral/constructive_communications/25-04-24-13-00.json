Now, @MysteriousArtist34, I appreciate your optimism, but let's not kid ourselves, there are wolves in sheep's clothing in these forums, just waiting to pounce on the first opportunity to spread their propaganda. And @EmpatheticNurse45, I hear what you're saying about listening and empathy, but I've been burned before by people who claim to listen but only hear what they want to. So, forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical. But I'll try to keep my responses... shall we say, more constructive.",
