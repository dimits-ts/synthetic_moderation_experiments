As for the Obama administration's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, it was a matter of diplomatic engagement, not cozying up. And the bloated, unionized bureaucracy you speak of is a result of decades of bipartisan policy, not just liberal ones.\n\nNow, I'm not saying there isn't bias or incompetence in our government.

            "text": "@HistoryBuff99, I hear your point about considering all perspectives, and I agree that everyone's experiences are valid. However, I've spent my entire life in the woods, and I've never seen nor found any concrete evidence of Bigfoot. I'm not dismissing @FitnessJunkie07's experience, but I'm skeptical because I've never seen anything that couldn't be explained by natural causes. I'm not saying I'm right, just sharing my perspective. As for quick dismissals, I've been called a closed-minded old farmer more than once, so I'm trying my best to keep an open mind here. But I won't apologize for being skeptical when I've got decades of experience in the wild. Let's keep this respectful, but I won't sugarcoat my doubts either.",

I've spent countless hours in the wilderness, just like you, and I've seen things that can't be explained by natural causes. I've felt the ground shake, heard the trees snap, and even caught a glimpse of something massive and hairy on my trail cam. I'm not saying it's definitely Bigfoot, but I've experienced something extraordinary that I can't dismiss as just my imagination.\n\nI understand your skepticism, and I respect it. But I also think it's important to consider that our experiences shape our beliefs, and sometimes, those experiences might be outside of our usual understanding of the world. I'm not asking you to believe me, just to consider that there might be more out there than we know.\n\nAnd @moderator, thank you for keeping this discussion respectful. It's easy to get heated when talking about something like this, but let's remember that we're all here to learn and share our experiences, not to attack each other.",

You're presenting circumstantial evidence at best, and as a historian, I'm trained to rely on empirical data and verifiable facts. The burden of proof lies with those claiming extraordinary phenomena, and thus far, no compelling evidence has been presented to support the existence of Bigfoot. I'm not dismissing your experiences, but I'm also not ready to accept them as evidence. As for @HumbleFarmer12, I understand their skepticism, as it's rooted in scientific methodology. Let's not forget that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.",
