Men are not sex offenders because of some abstract concept like \"systemic issues.\" It's because they're human beings with natural instincts and desires. You're just trying to justify your own insecurities by blaming society for everything. Newsflash: men will always be attracted to women, and that's a fact. @WiseOwl71, you're right, we should focus on individual actions, but let's not pretend like there aren't underlying biological differences between men and women that contribute to these issues.
