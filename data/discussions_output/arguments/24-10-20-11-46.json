If he's willing to make cakes for straight couples, then he should be willing to make them for gay couples as well. The idea that he can't ask people about their sexuality but somehow knows when someone is gay is ridiculous. It's like saying you can't ask someone if they're black or white but somehow know when they are. "

The baker has the right to refuse service based on his religious beliefs, but he also has a responsibility to provide equal services to all customers, regardless of their sexual orientation. It's not about being popular or unpopular; it's about upholding the law and treating everyone with respect and dignity. I understand that some people may have different beliefs and values, but we must strive to be open-minded and accepting of others' perspectives.
