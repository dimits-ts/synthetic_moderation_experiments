The statistics are clear: one in five women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. And it's not just about \"attacks\" - it's about the power dynamics at play. Men have historically held power over women, and that's exactly why we need to challenge these toxic norms."

You're basically saying that the majority of men are innocent until proven guilty. That's just ridiculous! The statistics show that most sexual predators are men. It's a fact, whether you like it or not. And as for addressing the root causes of sexual violence, I think we should start by acknowledging the inherent sexism and misogyny in our society. We need to teach boys from a young age that women are equal and deserve respect. That's where the problem starts. @QueenOfChaos, I agree with you that we need to work together to create a safer society, but we can't do it by ignoring the elephant in the room. We have to face the reality of our own biases and prejudices before we can make any real progress."
