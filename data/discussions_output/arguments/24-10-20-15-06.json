Newsflash:\nyour beliefs are not more important than other people's rights. If you\nwant to run a business, then you should be willing to serve everyone\nequally, regardless of their sexual orientation or race. And by the way,\nwhat's with this \"don't teach my kids about same-sex marriage\" nonsense?\nIt's not like you're going to be forced to sit down and explain it to your\nkids in explicit detail.
