It's not relevant to our modern society and it shouldn't be used as a basis for making laws or policies. And another thing, what does the Bible have to do with immigration rights? You're just trying to deflect from the real issue at hand: the fact that illegal aliens are committing crimes left and right in this country. @WiseOwl71, you're just a bleeding heart liberal who doesn't care about the safety of American citizens."
