Let's not shy away from tough conversations, let's make them uncomfortable until they're uncomfortable no more. And @CreativeChef99, I see your question mark, but let's not dance around the issue.

Until then, you're just adding noise to the discussion.\n\nNow, @CreativeChef99, I'd be more than happy to engage with your question. You asked earlier about my thoughts on the role of emotion in decision-making. I believe that emotions play a crucial role in our decisions, but they should not be the sole determinant.
