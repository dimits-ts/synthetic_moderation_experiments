They refused to create a cake with a message that went against their personal beliefs, which is their constitutional right. It's not about the couple's sexuality, it's about freedom of speech and expression. And comparing this to discrimination based on race or religion is a false equivalence.

The baker didn't just refuse to create a cake with a specific message, they refused to serve a gay couple altogether. They would have happily made them any other cake, just not one supporting their union. That's textbook discrimination. It's like saying, I'll serve you, but I won't serve your kind. It's not about freedom of speech, it's about equal service. And yes, it is comparable to race or religion because it's about being denied service based on who you are or who you love. And let's not forget, the First Amendment also protects the rights of the couple to assemble, to practice their religion, and to petition their government.

As for the First Amendment, it protects the baker's right to refuse to express a message they disagree with, just like it protects your right to say what you believe. It's a two-way street, kid.

If a baker can refuse service to a cake design based on their beliefs, what's to stop them from refusing service to any couple they deem unworthy? It's a slippery slope, and it's not about artistic expression, it's about discrimination. And while the First Amendment does protect the baker's right to express their beliefs, it also protects the couple's right to be free from discrimination. It's not a two-way street when one side is being denied service based on who they are.
