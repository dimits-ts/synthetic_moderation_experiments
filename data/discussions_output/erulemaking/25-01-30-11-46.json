            "text": "@QueenOfChaos, I appreciate your response, but I want to gently steer the conversation back on track. While I understand your frustration, addressing the topic at hand is crucial, and I encourage you to do so. However, I also want to acknowledge @GoldenYears66's effort to rephrase their point in a calm and respectful manner. \n\n@QueenOfChaos, can you try to separate the topic from the tone and language used? Let's focus on the substance of the discussion. What are your thoughts on creating a more inclusive environment for people with differing opinions, as @GoldenYears66 initially suggested?",
