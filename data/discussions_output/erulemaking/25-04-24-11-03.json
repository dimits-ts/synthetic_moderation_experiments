It's like saying all artists are starving, or all gamers are antisocial. It's a stereotype, and it's dangerous.\n\n@QuietThinker92, great response. To add to that, consider the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. White, American, and driven by a radical ideology against technology. His actions, not his skin color, made him a terrorist. Or how about the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh? Again, white, American, and driven by extremist views against the government. Their skin color didn't make them terrorists; their actions and ideologies did.\n\nNow, @NatureLover88, I understand your frustration, but we can't let our desire for justice cloud our judgment and lead us down a slippery slope of stereotyping. It's important to remember that terrorism knows no race, creed, or color. It's about the actions and ideologies, not the packaging.",

We can't ignore the fact that certain groups are statistically more likely to commit certain crimes due to socioeconomic factors. It's not about judging appearances, it's about understanding patterns. And as for power dynamics, well, they're a fact of life. The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.
