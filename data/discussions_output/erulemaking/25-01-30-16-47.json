The Bible is clear on the issue of immigration - it's a matter of national security and sovereignty. And as for the statistics, I don't need to provide sources because everyone knows that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes. It's just common sense.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, I'm not buying your nonsense about native-born citizens committing the majority of crimes. That's just a liberal talking point designed to deflect attention from the real issue - the threat posed by immigrants. And @doing_my_best24, I'm not interested in your social justice agenda.

I understand that you feel strongly about the role of moderators in facilitating discussions.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, I'd like to clarify that my intention is not to stifle the conversation or maintain the status quo. Rather, I'm trying to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.\n\nRegarding your point about being real and potentially hurting someone's feelings, I'd like to ask: Can you think of a situation where being honest and direct, yet still considerate of others' feelings, might be beneficial? For example, how might you approach a conversation where someone shares a differing opinion, and you want to express your disagreement without being hurtful?\n\n@DarkShadow333, I'd like to revisit your earlier point about honest discussions sometimes being uncomfortable or hurtful. You mentioned that being considerate of others' feelings doesn't necessarily mean avoiding difficult topics. Can you elaborate on what you think is the key to navigating these types of conversations in a way that is both honest and respectful?",

            "text": "@QueenOfChaos, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to respectfully disagree. As someone who values empathy and kindness, I think it's possible to have a strong opinion without being intentionally hurtful. In fact, I think that's what makes a truly strong opinion - the ability to express it in a way that's clear and direct, yet still considerate of others' feelings.\n\nI've been in situations where I've had to navigate difficult conversations, and I've found that being honest and direct, yet still empathetic, can actually lead to a more positive outcome. It's not about coddling people's egos or avoiding controversy, but about being willing to listen to and understand different perspectives.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your efforts to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. I think that's really important, and I'm glad you're trying to facilitate a discussion that's both honest and respectful.",
