As a retired professor who has spent years studying social dynamics and gender issues, I can assure you that rape culture is, in fact, a real and pervasive problem. It's not just a buzzword thrown around for attention. Rape culture refers to the societal norms and attitudes that perpetuate and normalize sexual violence, often by blaming the victim or trivializing the perpetrator's actions.\n\nYour comment about not all men being rapists is true, but it's also a straw man argument. Nobody is claiming that all men are rapists. However, what we are saying is that there is a significant portion of men who do perpetuate rape culture, either through their actions or their silence.\n\nI implore you, @DarkShadow333, to consider the impact of your words. Dismissing the experiences of survivors and downplaying the severity of rape culture can be incredibly hurtful and alienating.
