The Bible doesn't explicitly mention immigration rights because it was written in a different time and context. It's like saying the Constitution should be applied to modern issues without considering the historical context. "

It's not about immigration rights specifically, but about treating others with kindness and compassion. And by the way, I'm tired of seeing people like you always bringing up statistics without providing any context or perspective. You're just trying to scare people into believing that all illegal aliens are murderers! That's not true and it's not fair."

As a retired professor, I've studied the scriptures extensively, and I can assure you that Jesus' teachings emphasize compassion, empathy, and understanding towards all people, regardless of their immigration status. The notion that God's laws are about hating or fearing others is a gross misinterpretation."

According to the FBI, in 2022, there were 3,450 murders committed by U.S.-born citizens in California alone. Meanwhile, there is no reliable data on the number of murders committed by undocumented immigrants in California. It's important to separate fact from fiction and not perpetuate harmful stereotypes about a group of people based on their immigration status. @doing_my_best24, I appreciate your efforts to promote inclusivity, but we need to focus on evidence-based solutions that benefit all members of our society.\n"
