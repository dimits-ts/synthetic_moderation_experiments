And let me tell you, it's not just a few isolated incidents that have made me skeptical about our government. I've seen firsthand how corrupt and incompetent they can be. So, excuse me if I don't buy into your \"all Muslims are terrorists\" nonsense. @WiseOwl71, I agree with you too. But let's not forget that there are some real problems in this country that need to be addressed. And maybe we should start by looking at the people who are actually responsible for our national security, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. They're the ones who have been compromised by foreign interests and have put our country at risk. So, let's not get too caught up in labeling each other as racists or bigots. Let's focus on finding solutions to our problems instead of just pointing fingers.\n"
