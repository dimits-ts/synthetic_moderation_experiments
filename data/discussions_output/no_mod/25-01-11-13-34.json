And your anti-American newspaper claim is just a right-wing conspiracy theory. As for the Awans, there's no evidence they had ties to terrorist groups. You're just spewing baseless accusations. Typical of someone who thinks liberal is a dirty word. Maybe if you spent less time watching Tucker Carlson and more time reading actual news, you'd have a clue. But hey, it's easier to blame lazy liberals than to admit that maybe, just maybe, the system is broken because of people like you who can't think for themselves. \ud83d\ude44",

As for the Awans, the evidence is there if you'd bother to look. But you're too busy drinking the liberal Kool-Aid to see it. And don't you dare lecture me about thinking for myself. I've been around longer than you, sweetheart. I've seen this country go from great to a laughing stock under liberal leadership. So, keep your smug attitude and your actual news to yourself.
