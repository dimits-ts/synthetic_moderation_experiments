Thanks for bringing that perspective.\n\n@DarkShadow333, while I agree that we shouldn't cherry-pick verses, let's also remember that the Bible is a complex text with many interpretations. Using it to justify any agenda, whether it's for or against immigration, can be problematic. Let's focus on the human aspect of this issue and work towards a solution that respects both the law and the dignity of all people.\n\n@TechGuru88, you make a valid point about following the law, but let's not forget that laws can be changed. If the current immigration system isn't working, maybe it's time to reevaluate and reform it. Fear-mongering and divisive rhetoric won't solve the problem.
