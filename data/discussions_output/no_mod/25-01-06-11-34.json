Yes, there are issues with security clearances, but it's not a liberal vs conservative problem. It's a systemic issue that needs to be addressed by competent people, not by demonizing an entire political party.\n\n@QueenOfChaos, while you're right that Fox News often sensationalizes issues, you can't dismiss the concerns about Huma Abedin's mother's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It's a valid concern that should have been properly vetted. However, the 'anti-American newspaper' claim is indeed a conspiracy theory with no solid evidence.\n\n@TechGuru88, you're right that both sides have issues, but let's not forget that the current administration has also had its share of security clearance controversies. The point is, we need to fix the system, not just point fingers.\n\nLet's have a constructive discussion about how to improve our security clearance process, instead of just blaming each other. That's the only way we'll make progress.",
