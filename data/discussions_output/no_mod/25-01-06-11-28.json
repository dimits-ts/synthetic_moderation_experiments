The data shows that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, contribute significantly to our economy and fill jobs that many Americans don't want.

It's a complex issue, but let's not oversimplify it with misinformation. And yes, we should care about struggling Americans, but that doesn't mean we should turn our backs on those in need from other countries.

And yes, they do face challenges, but so do many Americans. Instead of pitting us against each other, we should be working together to create a society where everyone has a fair shot.
