As for your question, it's important to note that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not criminals. According to a study by the Cato Institute, the criminal conviction rate for undocumented immigrants is actually lower than that of native-born Americans. So, while any crime is one too many, it's not accurate to paint all undocumented immigrants with the same brush. Let's focus on facts and solutions, not fear and division. ",
