However, I'll take the bait one last time.\n\nScience is not a matter of opinion; it's based on evidence and rigorous testing. The American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and countless other reputable organizations have all concluded that homosexuality and being transgender are natural variations of human sexuality and gender identity. If you choose to ignore this consensus, that's your prerogative, but don't expect others to take your unfounded beliefs seriously.\n\nAs for education, it's not about pushing an agenda; it's about providing accurate information so that people can make informed decisions. If you're so confident in your beliefs, surely you wouldn't mind a little education to back them up. But if you'd rather stick to your conspiracy theories and insults, that's your choice. Just don't expect anyone to take you seriously.",
