No one is saying men can't be victims, but the majority of sexual assault cases involve male perpetrators. And dressing a certain way doesn't invite assault. It's about the perpetrator's actions, not the victim's clothing. Let's not shift the blame onto the victims.\n\n@WiseOwl71, you're absolutely right.
