The issue of toxic masculinity and harassment has been going on for far too long, and it's understandable that people are tired of empty platitudes and promises of change.\n\nWhile I agree that not all men are creeps, it's also true that many men are complicit in toxic behavior by staying silent or laughing it off. We need to hold everyone accountable, not just the most egregious offenders. And yes, change does take time, but that doesn't mean we should be patient with harmful behavior.\n\nLet's not dismiss the valid emotions of those who have been hurt and marginalized. Instead, let's channel that energy into productive conversations and actions that lead to real change.
