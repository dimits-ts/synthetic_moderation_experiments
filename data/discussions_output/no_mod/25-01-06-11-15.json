And let's not forget, just because a man hasn't raped someone doesn't mean he's a saint. I've seen plenty of 'good men' turn a blind eye to harassment or make excuses for their friends' bad behavior. So, let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet. And as for having a'real conversation', sure, let's have one. Let's talk about how men can do better, how they can be better allies, and how they can call out their friends when they see them acting like creeps.
