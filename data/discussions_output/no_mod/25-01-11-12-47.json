We need more of that, not just calling out the bad behavior. And @QueenOfChaos, while it's true that the 'not all men' argument can be dismissive, we also can't paint all men with the same brush.

So keep on with your 'not all men' nonsense while the rest of us deal with the actual problem. And by the way, @QueenOfChaos, you're right. I am dying to be the good guy.
