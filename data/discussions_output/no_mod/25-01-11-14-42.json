No one, regardless of what they wear, deserves to be attacked. Let's focus on the real issue here: consent and respect.

That's just plain wrong. But @DarkShadow333, while the system does need to change, let's not forget that change starts with us. We all have a part to play in this, men and women alike. We need to teach our kids, our friends, our family about consent and respect. And we need to hold those who cross the line accountable, regardless of their gender. It's not about 'precious masculinity', it's about basic human decency. Let's not let this conversation turn into a blame game. We're all in this together.",
