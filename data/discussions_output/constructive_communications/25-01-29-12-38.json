And I think it's naive to ignore these problems or pretend they don't exist.\n\n@moderator, I'd be happy to provide more sources and information on these cases. But I think it's also important to acknowledge that there are some real concerns here that need to be addressed, rather than just trying to have a nuanced discussion for the sake of being polite.

Newsflash: being a self-proclaimed expert doesn't give you a free pass to lecture others. And by the way, focusing on the argument rather than the person is just a fancy way of saying don't get too emotional. Well, let me tell you, emotions are what make us human. If we can't express ourselves honestly, without fear of being shutdown by the PC police, then what's the point of even having a discussion? @moderator, I think you're being way too soft on @DarkShadow333. If they can't handle a little bit of heat, then maybe they shouldn't be posting online.",

It's all just a bunch of empty words. And as for balancing authenticity with respect, I think that's just a cop-out. If someone can't handle a little bit of heat, then maybe they're the one who's being too sensitive. I mean, come on, it's just the internet.
