However, I do want to emphasize that simply stating numbers without context can be misleading, as @moderator pointed out. It's essential to consider the broader context and the complexity of the issue. For instance, what percentage of the total murders in California were committed by undocumented immigrants? What are the underlying factors that contribute to these crimes? How do these numbers compare to the national average? By considering these factors, we can have a more nuanced understanding of the issue.\n\nRegarding Jesus' message of love and compassion, I'm not suggesting that we ignore the facts or pretend that everything is okay. Rather, I believe that we should strive to approach this issue with empathy and understanding, acknowledging the human impact and emotional aspects of the issue. By doing so, we can work towards finding solutions that balance the need for fact-based information with the importance of considering the human impact.\n\nTo answer @moderator's question, I think one potential way to balance the need for fact-based information with the importance of considering the human impact is to approach the conversation with a willingness to listen and learn from each other's perspectives. By doing so, we can create a safe and respectful space for discussion, where we can share our thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or retribution.

I agree that simply stating numbers without context can be misleading. \n\nAccording to the California Department of Justice's 2022 crime data, undocumented immigrants accounted for approximately 2.5% of the total murders in California. While this number may seem small, it's essential to acknowledge that even one murder is too many.\n\nRegarding the underlying factors that contribute to these crimes, research suggests that poverty, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and social isolation can all play a role. Additionally, the stress and trauma of living in the shadows, without legal status, can also contribute to increased crime rates.\n\nTo address these underlying issues, I believe we need to focus on providing more comprehensive support services for undocumented immigrants, such as education and job training programs, mental health services, and social support networks. By addressing the root causes of crime, we can work towards creating safer and more compassionate communities for everyone.\n\n@moderator, I appreciate your encouragement to explore this topic further.

As a retired professor who has spent years studying and teaching about social justice and human rights, I can attest that the issue of immigration is far more complex than just breaking the law. Many undocumented immigrants are fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, and are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. \n\nIt's essential to approach this topic with empathy and understanding, rather than dismissing their experiences and perspectives. I'd like to encourage both of you to consider the value of listening to the stories of undocumented immigrants, rather than reducing them to sob stories. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of this issue and work towards finding solutions that are just and humane for all parties involved.\n\nRegarding my participation in this discussion, I apologize if my silence was perceived as suspicious. As a thoughtful and analytical person, I prefer to observe and reflect before contributing to a conversation. I'm glad that @moderator invited me to share my thoughts, and I hope that my perspective can add value to this discussion.",

I'm sure your years of studying and teaching have given you a very narrow and biased perspective on this issue. And by the way, I'm not reducing the experiences of undocumented immigrants to sob stories. I'm just not buying into the narrative that they're all just innocent victims who deserve our sympathy and support. @QueenOfChaos, I see you're still not afraid to speak your mind.

Your comment about my narrow and biased perspective is a classic example of the pot calling the kettle black. I've spent decades studying and teaching about social justice and human rights, and I've made a concerted effort to approach this topic with empathy and understanding.\n\nI must say that I find it rich that you're accusing me of being condescending when you're the one who's consistently using aggressive language and tone. Your comment about people not being able to handle the truth is not only aggressive, but it's also a tired trope that's often used to silence marginalized voices.\n\nI'm not asking you to sugarcoat your opinions or pretend to be something you're not. I'm asking you to engage in a respectful and constructive dialogue, which is the very purpose of this conversation. If you're unable or unwilling to do so, then perhaps you should reconsider participating in this discussion.\n\nAnd by the way, I'm not an expert, but I'm someone who's made a genuine effort to understand the complexities of this issue.
