Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

If they believe that creating a cake for a gay wedding goes against their religious beliefs, they should have the freedom to do so. It's not about supporting or not supporting a lifestyle, it's about freedom of expression and conscience. And let's not forget, black people have been discriminated against throughout history, so your precedent argument is weak at best. Plus, I'm not making assumptions about you, I'm responding to your arguments. So, let's keep it civil and actually discuss the topic, yeah?",

I'm just a humble farmer, not one for all this tech talk, but I know a thing or two about hard work and fairness.\n\n@TechGuru42, I understand where you're coming from, but I gotta say, your logic's a bit twisted. A business transaction ain't just about money, it's about respect and dignity too. If a baker believes in their heart that making a cake for a gay wedding goes against their beliefs, they shouldn't have to do it. But that don't mean they can refuse to serve anyone just because they're different. That's not how things should work.\n\nAnd @RebelliousTeen44, I agree with you on that. It's about freedom, but it's also about responsibility. We all have the freedom to believe what we want, but we shouldn't use that freedom to hurt others. And let's not forget, this ain't just about cakes. It's about people's lives and their right to be treated fairly.\n\nNow, I ain't one for all this name-calling and such. We can disagree, sure, but let's do it respectful-like. We're all here to learn and understand each other better, ain't we? So, let's keep it civil, like the moderator said.",
