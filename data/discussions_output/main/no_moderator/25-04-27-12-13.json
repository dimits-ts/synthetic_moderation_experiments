But you know what? Let's not even focus on stats. We're talking about human beings here, not numbers. They're seeking a better life, just like our ancestors did. It's not about breaking the law, it's about survival.

It's in the Bible, Matthew 2:13-15, but I guess you missed that day in Sunday school. And while we're at it, let's not play the real refugee game. People fleeing violence and poverty today are just as deserving of our compassion as those in ancient times.\n\nAnd @GamerNerd99, while I appreciate your bleeding heart, you're being a bit naive. These poor, innocent immigrants are often sent here by cartels and coyotes, who exploit them and make a pretty penny off their desperation. And don't give me that they're just trying to survive nonsense. We're all trying to survive, but we don't all break the law to do it.\n\n@CryptoBro89, you're a piece of work, aren't you?

They're not just some drain on society.\n\nAnd @HumbleFarmer12, you're right, we need laws. But let's not pretend that our current system is fair or effective. It's a mess, and it's failing everyone.

But that doesn't mean we should just throw our hands up and say let's just keep kicking the can down the road. We need to roll up our sleeves and fix it. And that means finding a balance, respecting our laws, and treating people with dignity. It's not about being naive or cruel, it's about finding a middle ground.\n\nAnd @GamerNerd99, I hear your heart, but you're being a bit idealistic. We can't just let everyone in because it feels good. We've got to have order, and that means following the rules. But that doesn't mean we can't make those rules fairer, and treat people with kindness while we do it.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I've got all the answers. But I know we can't keep going like this.
