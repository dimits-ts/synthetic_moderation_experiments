Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

If a business opens its doors to the public, it should serve everyone equally. That's what anti-discrimination laws are for – to ensure fair treatment. Comparing this situation to Satanists discriminating against Christians doesn't hold up because those are different contexts and legal frameworks.

If the baker feels strongly against something, shouldn’t they have the right to refuse service without being labeled as discriminatory? It’s a slippery slope when you start saying businesses must cater to everyone regardless of personal beliefs. What’s next, forcing artists to paint nude models if they don’t believe in it?
