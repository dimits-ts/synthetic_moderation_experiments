Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\n",

      "text": "@NatureLover88 So, let’s break this down. First off, artists DO take pride in their work, but that doesn’t mean they should be forced to create something that goes against their beliefs. And yes, it’s a business transaction, but it’s also about personal beliefs. \n\nNow, you’re saying he should cater to everyone equally, but what about the baker’s rights? Shouldn’t he have a say too? It’s not just about the money; it’s about standing up for what you believe in. \n\nAnd seriously, the whole “Jesus would be mad” thing? Really? Are we basing laws on biblical interpretations now? That’s just ridiculous. \n\nAlso, this idea that everyone should get service no matter what – that’s great in theory, but what about the flip side? What if someone doesn’t want to serve a Satanic ritual? Where do we draw the line?\n\nJust because something is legal doesn’t mean it’s right, and vice versa. We need to start thinking about these issues more critically instead of just blindly following whatever the law says.",

If we let one person opt out because of their beliefs, why stop there? What's next, refusing to serve vegans because you think meat is better? This isn't about being nice or understanding; it's about setting a precedent. Once you start carving out exceptions, the whole system falls apart. \n\n@RebelliousTeen44, you mentioned personal beliefs, but at what cost? If every business owner can pick and choose their customers based on beliefs, how do we maintain any semblance of equality? It's not about being forced to do something; it's about the consequences of allowing discrimination under the guise of personal beliefs. \n\nLet's be real, folks.
